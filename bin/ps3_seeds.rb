In XIII, one of the fal'Cie—a god-like race—transformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the hope that they would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.
#
#XIII-2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro.

Nail'd is a racing game that is all about eschewing boring realism for over the top arcade fun. It's a racer that challenges everything from player reflexes through to the rules of physics. Riding on ATVs and motocross bikes with powerful boost controls, players will race down near-vertical courses of incredible jumps, stunts and obstacles. The brutal challenge of the Yosemite National Park is but one of the places they’ll learn the meaning of verticality.

Nail'd's single-player campaign features various configurable modes and races including Tournament, Time Attack and Quick Event. The multi-player mode allows players to compete head to head in a range of race-types with multiple mutators, locally or online. Earned points will determine a player's position on leader boards and based on the player's performance and ability to pull off stunning feats of speed and glory during each race, they'll unlock exciting new components to customize their vehicle.", :release_date => "2010-11-30", :title => "Nail'd", :developer => "Techland", :publisher => "Deep Silver", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9745-1.jpg')

Snake’s journey takes him into a world where he is driven by a need for revenge and the pursuit of a shadow group, XOF.


Hideo Kojima, head of Kojima Productions, continues to ambitiously explore mature themes such as the psychology of warfare and the atrocities that result from those that engage in its vicious cycle. One of the most anticipated games of the year with its open-world design, photorealistic visual fidelity and feature-rich game design, MGSV: The Phantom Pain will leave its mark as one of the hallmarks in the gaming industry for its cinematic storytelling, heavy themes, and immersive tactical gameplay.


Key Features:

-	Open-World game design allowing players ultimate freedom on how to approach missions and overall game progression 

-	Fox Engine delivers photorealistic graphics, thoughtful game design and true new-generation game production quality

-	Online connectivity that carries the experience beyond the consoles to other devices to augment the overall functionality and access to the game", :release_date => "2015-06-30", :title => "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain", :developer => "Kojima Productions", :publisher => "Konami", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11127-1.jpg')

The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar's normal moveset. The game's new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]

The game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as \"OMG! Moments.\" This feature allows players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd's chants, cheering and booing being dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original, being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE '13 will also feature WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows, rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.

On September 21, it was confirmed that WWE '13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]", :release_date => "2012-10-30", :title => "WWE '13", :developer => "Yuke's", :publisher => "THQ", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11158-1.jpg')

A group of American soldiers, which includes the protagonist, Captain Nathaniel Renko, goes to investigate, when another surge disables their helicopter. After they crash land on Katorga-12, Renko begins to phase between the present and 1955, the date of a catastrophic accident on the island. He arrives in 1955 in time to save a scientist named Nikolai Demichev from dying in a fire. As he rescues Demichev, a man tries to warn Renko not to save him; the man is then killed in the fire.

Back in the present, Renko discovers that Demichev has taken over the world. He is captured by Demichev's soldiers, but is rescued by Katheryn, a member of a resistance group called Mir-12. Based on a journal they found on Katorga-12, they believe that Renko can put an end to Demichev's reign using a time manipulation device called the TMD, developed by Victor Barisov. Barisov was killed by Demichev long ago, so Renko uses the TMD to save Barisov.

Back in the present, Renko and Barisov determine that they can set history right by returning to 1955 and destroying Katorga-12 with a bomb made from Element-99, the material that caused the catastrophic accident in 1955. Renko and Katheryn manage to find such a bomb, but Katheryn is lost as they retrieve it. They use the bomb to destroy the island, and thus, the research facility that Demichev used to become so powerful.

Back in the present, Renko finds Demichev holding Barisov at gunpoint. Demichev reveals that he rebuilt the facility after it was destroyed, so that history remained unchanged. Barisov realizes that it was Demichev's rescue that changed history, so he asks Renko to go back and stop his past self from saving Demichev. Demichev, in turn offers Renko a place in his empire in exchange for the TMD. He also points out that Barisov's plan has failed before – the mysterious man who told Renko not to save Demichev in 1955 was Renko himself.

At this point, the player has a choice. If Renko shoots Demichev, he goes back in time to stop himself from saving Demichev in the first place. In order to do so, he decides to kill his past self. In the epilogue, it is implied that Barisov recovered the TMD and used it to conquer the world himself. If Renko instead shoots Barisov, he and Demichev rule the world together. After some time, Demichev begins to fear Renko's growing power, and a cold war develops between the lands ruled by Renko and those ruled by Demichev. If Renko shoots both Demichev and Barisov, Renko allows the world to fall into chaos. Later, he rises up as a new world leader, using the TMD to assert his power.

A scene then shows a wounded Katheryn, pulled into 1955 by a time distortion, writing the Mir-12 journal which will later be used to track down Renko.", :release_date => "2010-06-29", :title => "Singularity", :developer => "Raven", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11915-1.jpg')

Rick can lose limbs, but is able to grow them back over time. Arms can be used as clubs to fight enemies.

Throughout the game, Rick collects blood from defeated enemies. Collecting a certain amount will allow the player to unlock new moves and perform special attacks. Players can find journals documenting Dr. West's history while photos of Rick's girlfriend serve as a breadcrumb trail to follow. He can perform \"Splatter Kills\", extremely gory finishing moves. There is also a platforming element with jump nodes to keep instant death falls to a minimum.

The game also comes with the original Splatterhouse arcade game, Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3 as unlockables.", :release_date => "2010-11-23", :title => "Splatterhouse", :developer => "Namco Bandai Games", :publisher => "Namco Bandai Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12283-1.jpg')

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.", :release_date => "2011-11-08", :title => "Metal Gear Solid HD Collection", :developer => "Kojima Productions", :publisher => "Konami", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12306-1.jpg')

With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses.[6] Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing as evidenced by the large landscapes.[7] Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound.[8]

Ico's remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing of the game, the player can restart the game to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player-character's companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda.[9] Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support,[10] the final game does not ship with it.

With the newly introduced \"magichange\" feature, monsters are able to transform into specific weapons in which a partner can use to execute a strong technical attack.

The player must reclaim cultist fortifications on the disaster-ravaged surface of the planet and defend colonists from hostile Martian creatures in the ancient mines and chasms beneath it and cleansing infestations from all structures.

Using the Magnet Gun, Darius, the main protagonist, fires first at one object, then at a second object, and then the first object rockets toward the second.

The Nano-Forge returns, having been passed down through two generations of the Mason family. Darius' father has incorporated the tool with a function that reverses any and all destruction dealt to man-made objects. The Nano-Forge will also feature an ability known as Impact, which discharges an incredibly powerful burst of force which can blow away structures and throw enemies off their feet.

Darius' Nano-Forge, weapons and armor are all upgradeable, improving their efficiency, unlocking new abilities, and altering their appearances.

At E3, Volition debuted the LEO exosuit, \"a robotic suit with powerful weaponry whose biggest strength nonetheless appears to be its ability to crash through structures with little effort. Darius piloted the LEO at full speed through a horde of aliens, splattering them on contact, and then brought down an infested building by crashing through its walls.\"[5]

The game features co-operative multiplayer for up to four players, called Infestation, which features two different game modes, survival where you need to survive against waves of increasingly challenging alien attackers and defensive where you need to defend areas from attack.

In a six-part YouTube series, the game's main storyline developer Leo and Max revealed \"Ruin mode\". This mode consists of nothing but \"blowing stuff up\". Players can either take all the time they want, or cause as much destruction as possible within one minute. The latter mode will have supported worldwide and friend leaderboards.[4][6]

However, Ruin mode will only be available to players who buy the game new or purchase a code online, as players are given the choice to either play the demo of the mode or enter a code using the methods stated above.", :release_date => "2011-06-07", :title => "Red Faction: Armageddon", :developer => "Volition Inc.", :publisher => "THQ", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12439-1.jpg')

It's survival horror as it's never been seen before! The House of the Dead: Overkill is a pulp-style take on the classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. The game takes place as Special Agent G - the hero of The House Of The Dead series - is given his first assignment fresh out of the AMS academy.

Blazkowitz is the general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. 

He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant.

The new \"TruBroadcast\" feature makes a point of focusing on player reactions, the in-game commentary now includes more season-specific discussions, and a completely revamped baseball physics engine results in more realistic bounces and bloops than ever before.

MLB 12's \"Franchise\" mode has been tweaked to produce more plausible trade scenarios, so rebuilding teams will be more likely to acquire prospects while contenders will seek impact veterans. Draft-eligible position players now reflect traditional baseball archetypes, such as a slugging first baseman or an all-glove shortstop, while computer-generated pitchers now have more realistic pitch repertoires -- no more power pitchers who also throw baffling knuckleballs. New minor adjustments include customized \"Play Now\" matches and settings that remain fixed across all modes.

The biggest addition in MLB 12: The Show is the \"Diamond Dynasty\" mode, which allows gamers to manage their own custom online team, recruit star players, and take on other custom online teams to earn development points. PlayStation Move controls have been fully integrated in MLB 12, allowing players to pitch, run, field, and hit using their Move Motion Controller across all game modes.

In a storyline set in 2014, you'll play as a Russian agent sent to stop a terrorist attack in Paris, a Marine corporal in the Tehran desert, and as others in missions set in Sarajevo, New York, Wake Island, Oman, and Sulaymaniyah. The Frostbite physics engine introduced in the Battlefield: Bad Company spin-off series has been enhanced, now allowing for the complete destruction of buildings and scenery objects, as well as vision blurring or blinding effects. Soldiers can also shoot from the prone position.

The multiplayer game features a choice of team-based options. Conquest has your side trying to claim and hold different areas of the battlefield, while rush involves one team trying to quickly advance across a map as the other team defends. Team deathmatch is also included, and there are four available classes in the game: assault, support, recon, and engineer. Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 titles are designed to run at 30 frames per second at 720p resolution.

As (at least) the fourth original console and home computer Call of Duty title set during World War II, World at War offers an expanded selection of era-authentic infantry and vehicle weapons, as well as the tactics that go with them, such as using flamethrowers to burn away camouflaging cover and expose hidden enemies. For the first time in the series, co-operative multiplayer gaming is strongly supported, with team-up options for two players to play through the main campaign in split-screen mode, or for as many as four to play together online.

Call of Duty: World at War is set in the Pacific Theater and in Europe, near the end of the war. In the single-player campaigns, players take the role of a United States Marine or a Russian infantry soldier, and face an onslaught of deadly new techniques, including brutal guerrilla warfare and kamikaze attacks. In online multiplayer games, an increased emphasis on squad tactics in chaotic, bombed-out environments makes coordinated teamwork the deadliest weapon of all.", :release_date => "2008-11-11", :title => "Call of Duty: World at War", :developer => "Treyarch", :publisher => "Activision Blizzard", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13854-1.jpg')

The game features detailed graphics and dramatic, seamless battles, expected from a next generation console. The plans are to have characters and movement reminiscent of the animation, and high-intensity battles.

During each battle, find conditions to create new dramatic scenes. After the battles, watch a unique story unfold each time you play. There is also a stronger element of offense and defense, due to added energy saving and fighting techniques. Features:
Online Feature - Competition grows with the ability to play online in both the co-op and vs. modes.
Unique DBZ Story -During each battle, find conditions to create new scenes and watch a unique story unfold at the end of each game.
Higher Quality Gaming - Experience visuals and movement reminiscent of the anime due to Z3 shading technology and detailed effects.
High Intensity battles - Increased speed of charge and release on the field, free movement around the field, and increased speed and power of attacks.
Energy - Use of special skills will no longer drain energy. The lower your energy, the stronger you get, making for a possible turnaround of the battle.
Fatal Blow - Each character in the game has their own \"Fatal Blow\". If the player successfully attacks his opponent, this would be a finishing move, but if not, it will put the player in the disadvantageous situation, and he must battle with no \"Fatal Blow\" for the rest of the battle.", :release_date => "2008-06-10", :title => "Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit", :developer => "", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14026-1.jpg')

As time progresses Alice loses touch with reality. She is institutionalized in Rutledge Asylum, where she is observed and treated by Dr. Heironymous Wilson. Alice's only possession in Rutledge is a stuffed rabbit. Ten years after Alice was committed to Rutledge, she finds herself sucked back into a Wonderland that has been twisted by her own broken mind. The White Rabbit summons Alice to aid a radically altered Wonderland, which became a twisted version of itself as it came under the horrible rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Cheshire Cat serves as Alice's companion throughout the game, frequently appearing to guide her with cryptic comments.

Sony Online Entertainment's stated goal is to make a different kind of MMORPG, with The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction cited as one of the main inspirations for gameplay. SOE is working to make DC Universe Online more interactive than standard MMORPGs, while trying to keep their key elements, which include a leveling system, raid instances, endgame progression and inventories. The world is mainly shared, public space instead of heroes or villains owning territory. The public space features dynamically-generated content designed for both hero and villain player characters (uniquely created by the player, who cannot choose DCU stalwarts).

Players will choose a mentor for their character (Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman for heroes and Lex Luthor, Joker, or Circe for villains). Their starting location, principal quest rewards and mob loot will be influenced by that decision. The starting zones are either Metropolis or Gotham City, for both heroes and villains. Heroes can also go to the Justice League Watchtower, while villains can enter the Secret Society of Super Villains headquarters at the Hall of Doom. Other safe-houses in the Gotham and Metropolis zones can be reached by teleporters from the two faction headquarters or from the two cities. For the heroes, it's various police stations. For the villains, it's various nightclubs owned by the villains.

Each character is given a communicator appropriate to their faction, via which they receive urgent communications from their mentor and his/her colleagues and subordinates; heroes will frequently receive status updates from Oracle, while villains will receive data from Calculator. In addition to assignments from their mentor, player characters may also receive requests for help from other mentors of the same faction. Player characters may also accept missions from non-player characters (NPCs) in the street, usually minor characters from their faction. There are also opportunities for quick street encounters appropriate to the character's faction: for example, a hero character may encounter a thug robbing an armored truck, trying to break into an office building, or in the process of mugging a citizen; while a villain character may be presented with opportunities to assist NPC thugs with an armored truck robbery, or assault a citizen using an ATM. All NPC interactions are fully animated and voice-acted. Player characters will earn threat ratings that will cause NPC heroes and villains to interact accordingly with the character.

The shared worldspace offers primarily solo and team player versus environment (PvE) gaming opportunities in the form of open air missions and instances, although player versus player (PvP) combat is also possible in this worldspace. Other PvP (and to a smaller extent, PvE) gaming is available in various types of queued instanced encounters: \"Legends\", small scale PvP combats in which players take on the identities of iconic characters (continued success in Legends combat unlocks additional iconic characters); \"Arena\", small scale PvP combat in which players fight as their own characters; \"Alerts\", cooperative team missions; and \"Raids\", Cooperative PvE missions that are larger than Alerts. Success in PvE missions is rewarded with in-game money, costume pieces, equipment and consumables, while PVP combat is rewarded with unlocks of special equipment sets.", :release_date => "2011-01-11", :title => "DC Universe Online", :developer => "Sony Online Entertainment", :publisher => "Sony Computer Entertainment / WB Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14367-1.jpg')

Just as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was something of a glorified expansion of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: Metallica serves as an extension of Activision's band-focused hit Guitar Hero: World Tour, offering gamers a feel for life in and around one of heavy metal's most popular and influential bands. The game features a total of 49 songs, including 28 original Metallica tracks, such as \"Seek and Destroy,\" \"Fade to Black,\" \"Master of Puppets,\" and \"One,\" and 21 band-selected songs from such acts as Bob Seger, Judas Priest, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. In general, the game's difficulty level was designed to be on par with that of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, however, the hard-hitting nature of some of Metallica's tracks led to the creation of an extremely difficult \"Expert+\" mode that can incorporate a second drum pedal.

Though band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo participated in motion-capture sessions to help create lifelike in-game avatars, the story actually finds players in the shoes of a band serving as Metallica's opening act. This narrative mechanic sends gamers to such real-world music venues as the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Forum in Los Angeles, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, and the Tushino Airfield in Russia. As always, players must earn high scores and unlock new songs by rhythmically matching onscreen prompts that correspond with musical notes. The music creation aspect of World Tour returns in Guitar Hero: Metallica, with new musical tones based on Hetfield's guitar and a new \"Drum Over\" mode that lets gamers play improvised drum tracks over any song, while the multiplayer \"Battle Mode\" comes equipped with new Metallica-themed power-ups such as \"Fade to Black,\" \"Ride the Lightning,\" and \"Trapped Under Ice.\"", :release_date => "2009-03-29", :title => "Guitar Hero: Metallica", :developer => "Neversoft Entertainment", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14374-1.jpg')

In the game's Quest mode, players lead eight individual characters to transform into heroic warriors, in a realm of studded black leather and dark gothic undertones. Characters use their individual special abilities to complete rock performance challenges and move the story forward, toward an ultimate battle that will determine the fate of the Demigod of Rock, and indeed, rock & roll itself.

Warriors of Rock hits retail shelves with the largest out-of-the-box playlist yet in the Guitar Hero series, boasting a total of more than 90 tracks from artists including Black Sabbath, Kiss, Megadeth, Anthrax, Def Leppard, and Soundgarden. Hits by artists such as Dire Straits, The Cure, Queen, and The Rolling Stones are also featured. A Quickplay option allows players instant access to the Rock Warrior characters' special powers, outside of the Quest campaign, and players can perform any combination of guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, in Party Play and other familiar Guitar Hero modes.

Gamers will get all of the 2010 MotoGP season content and downloadable updates for the 2011 MotoGP championship shortly after the season starts.

The all new handling system and improved physics in MotoGP 10/11 will deliver a level of authenticity never seen before in the GP series. The inclusion of the brand new customisable player assists feature allows fans of both simulation and arcade racing to alter their racing style. Those wanting to take less of a risk with their riding technique will be able to switch on the player assists for a more forgiving style of racing. For players who want to feel the full intensity of MotoGP racing, all the in-game player assists can be switched off, delivering challenging and realistic gameplay that emulates the MotoGP experience.

‘Career’ mode will be complimented with the addition of brand new co-op play. Through local splitscreen gameplay a second player can jump into the race and become a team mate, helping to take your team to pole position. The classic ‘Championship’ and ‘Time Trial’ modes are back along with a revised ‘Challenge’ mode. This year fans of the MotoGP will be able to play as their racing hero from the start in all three of these game modes.

As with MotoGP 09/10, MotoGP 10/11 will continue to offer the most robust online mode in a racing title, allowing up to 20 players to compete in a Championship race. Gamers can choose their racing settings and join in mid-race with spectator mode to check out the competition before the race starts. 

o The complete 2010 MotoGP season with free DLC for the 2011 MotoGP   championship shortly after the season starts
o Enhanced physics and handling system creating the most realistic MotoGP gaming experience
o Customisable player assists to emulate or tame the real world forces that riders have to deal with on track
o Five game modes including “Championship’, ‘Time Trial’, ‘Challenge’, ‘Career’ and ‘Online’
o The only racing game where you can compete with up to 20 players online
o Play with a team mate in ‘Career’ mode through the brand new addition of local co-op play

Play as 18 of your favorite Cartoon Network characters based on your favorite show, and look out for cameos from an additional 19 characters who jump in and assist in combat!

Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion is a mascot brawler fighting game bringing together several characters from the Cartoon Network Multiverse in one epic battle that plays very similarly to the Super Smash Bros. series. Up to four players (human or CPU controlled) control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter's Lab Stage players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.

When players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful \"Punch Time Explosion\" (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example, Ben turns into one of his aliens and launches missiles all over the stage.

In the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.

Each character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective shows. Each has an up, down, and side attack. Most characters have a projectile attack. Captain K'nuckles is the only character who has a disabling attack", :release_date => "2011-11-15", :title => "Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion XL", :developer => "Papaya Studio", :publisher => "Crave Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14590-1.jpg')

The game utilizes both third and first-person perspectives. In third person, the player controls Stranger when travelling long distance, platform jumping, rope climbing and melee combat while first person is like that of first person shooter games where ranged weapons are used. Enemies can be approached head on like a straight up action game or stealthily by hiding in long grass out of enemy sight (as indicated via mini map) and luring foes away from or toward the player.[9] Once enemies are encountered, they can be killed or knocked down/stunned temporarily; in this state they can be captured, thus earning more moolah than if they had been captured dead.[10] Upon an attempted capture, Stranger is unable to perform other actions and thus is vulnerable. The player has two status bars, health and stamina. When damage is taken, the health bar drops; if it fully depletes, it will result in the death of Stranger. Stamina drops when the player performs actions like melee attacks or falls from a great height. While it refills itself over time, it can be used to shake off health-bar damage, thus healing the player, but draining the stamina quicker.[9]
One of the game's main features is Stranger's crossbow that is used in a first person perspective that uses live ammunition in the form of using small fictional versions of real creatures as projectiles for differing effects. Live ammunition can be bought from the game's vendors or found scattered throughout the game world. When acquired, two different kinds of ammo can be assigned to the crossbow at any given time for two kinds of firing attack.[3] There are nine critters in total that can be used as ammo, such as Stunkz for stunning large groups of enemies, Thudslugs that work as cannonballs, Boombats that work as rockets, and Bees that are fired at foes like an automatic rifle.[3]
The game incorporates many role-playing elements in the form of earning moolah with each bounty fulfilled allowing it to be spent on upgrades such as crossbow, ammunition, storage and armour upgrades and other items such as binoculars and knuckle dusters.[11]", :release_date => "2011-12-27", :title => "Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD", :developer => "", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15028-1.jpg')

Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will.

KINGDOM HEARTS: FINAL MIX
In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The command menu has been updated to include \"Attack\", \"Magic\", \"Items\", and \"Summons\" in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a sub-category beneath the \"Magic\" menu. The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.

KINGDOM HEARTS: RE:CHAIN OF MEMORIES

Through-out Mega Man’s adventure he’ll take on the malfunctioning infected robots and classic-style bosses that can only found in Mega Man games. Each one has their own unique weapons and vulnerabilities. Great new additions to Mega Man 10 include the option to play as fan-favorite character Proto Man from the start, as well as an all new \"Easy Mode\" which will allow more fans to indulge in the challenges that make the series great. Additionally, “Mega Man Challenges” mode will allow players to practice their skills and prepare for the hair-raising adventures ahead of them.", :release_date => "2010-03-11", :title => "Mega Man 10", :developer => "Capcom", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15871-1.jpg')

The player must affect the surrounding and dynamic terrain to progress. The goal is to safely navigate through each vivid stage and rescue survivors scattered about the cavernous environment. Each stage is in-effect a flow simulation whereby the player attempts to control various types of liquid (water, magma, etc) and solid matter (rock, earth) either by destroying it, manipulating it or moving it. These dynamic fluid effects are at the heart of the games visuals. Strategy is paramount in PixelJunk Shooter. The piloted craft is susceptible to extremes of heat, so the player must be careful about the craft's proximity to magma. If the craft becomes too hot, the player can regain a comfortable temperature by plunging into the nearest water source. Additionally, each stage presents a puzzle scenario for the player to solve in order to safely rescue as many survivors as possible. Both environmental elements and enemies, including Bosses, will attempt to hamper the player's progress.", :release_date => "2009-12-10", :title => "PixelJunk Shooter", :developer => "Q Games", :publisher => "SCEA", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16188-1.jpg')

The D-pad moves Musashi around while the A, B and C buttons are used to perform a ninjitsu technique, attack and jump respectively. A key move in The Revenge of Shinobi is the somersault, which maximizes Musashi's jumping height and enables him to throw eight shuriken at once in mid-air. Additionally, some stages consist of multiple layers, such as the first scene of the Military Base and the freeway in Area Code 818.

Originally established as America's covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic.

In the spirit of the XCOM franchise, The Bureau's calculated combat design requires players to think and act tactically. The game's third-person perspective gives the player a sense of spatial awareness and grants them the freedom to transition in and out Carter's unique Battle Focus ability seamlessly -- heightening the tactical shooter action.

Assisted by hacker specialist Charlie Cole, Sam and Vic manage to escape, although Vic is severely injured from protecting Sam from a grenade. Soon after, a terrorist organization calling itself \"The Engineers\" claims responsibility for the attack and announces that this attack is the first of a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on United States assets which they call \"The Blacklist.\" They declare that they will halt the attacks only after the U.S. Government recalls all American troops deployed abroad.

In response, President of the United States Patricia Caldwell, who had just shut down the corrupt Third Echelon, assigns Fisher, Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Grímsdóttir to a newly created special operations and counter-terrorism unit called \"Fourth Echelon.\" She installs Sam as the commander and charges the unit with the task of hunting down The Engineers and stopping them. Fourth Echelon's base of operations is a customizable cargo plane, codenamed \"Paladin.\"

Sam and his new team's first course of action is to capture Andriy Kobin from a CIA safe house in Benghazi, Libya and obtain information from which they can learn more about The Engineers' plans. Sam successfully extracts Kobin and arrests him, keeping him aboard the Paladin. Kobin reveals some information about his business associates in Mirawa, Iraq. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold there, Sam learns that the Blacklist attacks are more serious than originally thought. Sam arrives at a death chamber to find an executed US soldier whose execution was taped. The executioner was Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota),[7] a terrorist and former MI6 agent. In the video, Sadiq directly tells Sam to stop intervening or suffer the consequences.

Intelligence from Mirawa points to the next Blacklist attack being in Dallas, Texas. Sam asserts to Fourth Echelon that a direct attack would be too simple and that the true target is another city. Charlie notes that the TSA list of \"do not fly\" citizens was offline for roughly six hours with a group of men traveling through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the time the list was offline. The target is a water filtration plant off Navy Pier, which is scheduled to release a hazardous biological agent into the water supply of Chicago. Sam stops the devices and shuts off the outflow valve, sparing Chicago.

Kobin reveals to Sam back on the Paladin intelligence about one of his associates, a dealer named Reza Nouri who supplies mercenaries for hire. Sam assaults his mansion in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay and interrogates Nouri. Nouri states that to whom he lends his men is none of Sam's business. During the interrogation, Nouri's mansion comes under attack from suspected operators of Quds Force. Nouri agrees to give up Sadiq in exchange for a safe extraction.

Grim and Charlie gain intelligence about a sleeper cell of The Engineers in London, England. The cell has been activated and Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill to gain intelligence on The Engineers' next plans. Sam finds shipping documents from Iran, confirming the suspicion that Iran and Quds Force were involved in the Blacklist attacks. With the last of the chemical bombs about to leave the shipping bay, Sam sneaks onto the truck and places a GPS tracking device inside the bomb. Sam is exposed to near lethal amounts of the chemical agent and, while trying to exfiltrate, is captured alive by Sadiq. Briggs, who was providing sniper overwatch, is forced to rescue Sam, but lets Sadiq escape.

After healing from the exposure to the chemical weapons, Sam infiltrates the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been transformed into a Quds Force headquarters. Sam installs a flash drive on a mainframe computer given to him by Charlie, which is programmed to search and rip anything related to the Blacklist attacks. The flash drive reveals nothing, proving that Iran is not behind the Blacklist attacks, reversing previous suspicions.

Back on the Paladin, Briggs informs Sam that the GPS tracker placed inside the bomb in London has reached US soil in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grim analyzes that there are a total of four bombs containing hazardous nerve agents. The bombs arrive at the transit yards in Philadelphia, forcing Sam and Briggs to disarm the bombs before the nerve agents are released into the mass transit system. Grim's analysis also assess that a high value Engineer target is present. After Sam and Briggs successfully defuse the fourth bomb, Sam gives chase to the Engineer leader in the transit system. The Engineer escapes the train, but is shot dead on site by responding police officers.

Returning to the Paladin empty handed, Fourth Echelon is given a break when Nouri is checked in as a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sam and Briggs form a plan to break into Guantanamo to interrogate Nouri again under Briggs' CIA credentials. Sam successfully interrogates Nouri who confirms that Sadiq is the mastermind behind the Blacklist attacks, but is unable to tell Sam when the next attack will be. Nouri also admits that Sadiq knows of Fourth Echelon and is aware of the team's individual identities. Sam evades capture and escapes the prison, riding off from the bay with the help of Briggs in a boat. Briggs drives himself and Sam to the Paladin, which has landed at an airstrip in the Yucatán province of Mexico.

Before Fourth Echelon can take off, the Paladin comes under assault by terrorists. Sam and Fourth Echelon fight off the attack, which Charlie reveals was his fault for contacting an old friend while landed. After taking off, the Paladin comes under a cyberattack directly from Sadiq. All of the intelligence on board the Paladin is compromised, as well as the on-board computers, leading the Paladin towards a crash in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourth Echelon successfully regains control of the Paladin, averting the crash. During the cyberattack, Sadiq successfully executes the \"American Fuel\" Blacklist attack on Sabine Pass, Louisiana, the largest oil reserve in the US.

While the US government activates continuity of government procedures, Sam assaults Sabine Pass, shutting down the leaking oil from reaching other reserve posts, averting a chain reaction. Another high value Engineer is present, to whom Sam gives chase. The Engineer reveals the true and final plans of Sadiq: to extract all US military secrets. Knowing continuity of government procedures, Sadiq successfully kidnaps a group of high level civilian and military personnel, including the Secretary Of Defense, and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport (DIA).

Fourth Echelon calls President Caldwell, who directly orders Fourth Echelon to divert from Denver. The Paladin pilots refuse to defy orders, so Sam orders Kobin to relieve the pilots of duty. Kobin successfully drops Briggs and Sam during a blackout landing at Denver. Briggs and Sam assault DIA, tasked with planting a virus which Charlie custom-built to safeguard against the transfer of files to Sadiq. Briggs surrenders to Sadiq in the computer terminal, separated from the other hostages. Sadiq's men torture the Secretary of Defense into complying with their demands, but Briggs intervenes, killing the Secretary before he can begin the data transfer.

The Engineers attempts to flee Site F using Briggs and the other hostages as human shields. It is revealed that Sam is disguised in an Air Force uniform at the very rear of the hostage group. Sam breaks free from his captors as Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men, and Sadiq escapes on foot after wounding Briggs. An unarmed Sam gives chase, disarming and assaulting Sadiq, before wounding him and taking him into custody. Even upon defeat, Sadiq claims that he has already \"won,\" threatening Sam that if he kills him, the twelve nations who are secretly backing The Engineers will rise and if he puts him on trial, he will \"spill every secret he knows.\" Leaving him with no choice, Sam employs the Fifth Freedom and unofficially imprisons Sadiq, while President Caldwell announces that he is killed and the game ends with Fourth Echelon prepares to continue operations. In the post-credits, it is revealed that Vic had recovered from his injuries and both he and Sam are seen about to interrogate the captive Sadiq.", :release_date => "2013-08-20", :title => "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist", :developer => "Ubisoft", :publisher => "Ubisoft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17669-1.jpg')

At character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4.

This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra.

\"In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new,\" Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity.

\"Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!\"

There are a couple of ways to get Ultra, due out in June on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in August on PC.

If you have Super Street Fighter 4 or Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition you can download Ultra Street Fighter 4 as a £10.99 / €14.99 / $14.99 digital upgrade for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in early June. The PC digital upgrade and the PC full digital bundle will both be available in August 2014.

Also in August the PS3 and Xbox 360 retail versions and full download version of the game will be released for £29.99 / €39.99 / $39.99.

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \"Citadel space\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \"First Contact War\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization.

The citizens were upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie made a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot was later uncovered by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him.

Following this, de Ferrer made a deal with a man named Baptiste, who was hoping to defect from the Assassins to the Templar Order. Baptiste pretended to act as the recently deceased François Mackandal, as a ruse to attract followers to his cause. He planned to poison New Orleans' nobles and take control of smuggling operations within the Louisiana Bayou. However, his sole purpose was to force Agaté, Assassin and mentor to Aveline, out of hiding in the bayou. Aveline tracked him down, however, killing his followers and assassinating the false Mackandal.

In 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left control of the area to French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating a rebellion among French officials and the citizens of New Orleans.

Agaté ordered Aveline to assassinate de Ulloa to eradicate Templar presence in New Orleans. Aveline ambushed de Ulloa's carriage and confronted the governor, who told her that slaves had been taken to Chichén Itzá. However, Aveline spared his life and let Ulloa leave the city, in return for a lens used to decode Templar documents and a map leading her to the Templar worksite in Chichén Itzá. Aveline's act of mercy destroyed any trust Agaté had in his student, as she had disobeyed his explicit orders.

Against her mentor's wishes, Aveline disguised herself as a slave bound for Mexico and made her way to the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá. Whilst there, she came across a defiant slave who mentioned that Jeanne, Aveline's mother, was stationed in Chichén Itzá. Aveline investigated thoroughly and uncovered a page from Jeanne's diary and a map that lead to an artifact located inside a cenote. Upon exploring this cave system, she came across an ancient chamber filled with ruins from the First Civilization, along with a fragment of the artifact she was searching for, known as the Prophecy Disk.

Shortly after Aveline had acquired the artifact, de Ferrer, who was supervising the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá, broke through into the chamber. However, Aveline overpowered his soldiers and killed him. At the end of the tunnels, she found Jeanne, who realized that her daughter was an Assassin and believed that Agaté had sent Aveline to kill her. She fled, though not before warning Aveline that the Prophecy Disk should never reach Agaté.

After two years of absence, Aveline returned to New Orleans to find that Spanish control was strong. After speaking to fellow Assassin Gérald Blanc, she learned that someone was bribing Spanish soldiers. Upon investigating, Aveline discovered that a man by the name of Vázquez was using Spanish soldiers to seize control of the bayou and take control of the bayou's smuggling operations, which would eventually lead him to discover the location of Agaté. Believing him to be the \"Company Man\", the head Templar of Louisiana, who de Ferrer mentioned in Chichén Itzá, Aveline immediately hurried to Agaté's hut to warn him of the threat posed by Vázquez's soldiers. Agaté told her to use the power of voodoo to spook the Spanish soldiers into abandoning their mission. Using her blowpipe, Aveline poisoned enough of Vázquez's soldiers so that the rest believed they were cursed and fled the bayou.

Aveline returned to Chichén Itzá and made peace with her mother, who directed her to a canoe inside another cenote. Aveline navigated her way through the cenote and retrieved the final piece of the Prophecy Disk. She offered to bring her mother back to New Orleans, but Jeanne decided to stay behind to take care of the community, which was now rid of Templar influence.

Aveline returned to New Orleans, continuously working to free slaves in the city. Her stepmother, Madeleine de l'Isle, became aware of her work and asked her to help a slave named George escape north. Aveline found a safe passage through the bayou for George to leave through. Whilst escorting him through the swamp, she met with her smuggler allies Élise Lafleur and Roussillon, helping them to deliver supplies to American patriots who were fighting in the American Revolutionary War.

Vázquez attempted to stop Aveline and her allies by sending Spanish soldiers their way, but failed. Aveline defeated Vázquez's soldiers and ensured George and the supplies reached their destination. After returning to the city, Aveline dressed herself in a noblewoman outfit and attended a governor's ball, in hopes that Vázquez would be there. After speaking with several guests, she located Vázquez and asked him to dance. Using her charm, she managed to assassinate him. However, to her surprise, Vázquez revealed that he was not the Company Man.

Aveline next spoke to Gérald, who told her that a Templar working for the Company Man had been found on the New York frontier. Aveline learned that the Templar was Officer Davidson, a Loyalist soldier of the Ethiopian Regiment. Aveline reached the New York frontier in 1777 and met Connor, a half Mohawk, half British Assassin fighting the Templars during the American Revolution.

Aveline and Connor made their way through the frontier to a fort where Officer Davidson was located. Connor distracted the guards and allowed Aveline to slip inside the fort. She confronted Officer Davidson, shocked to learn that he was actually George, the escaped slave she had helped flee north. He attempted to escape, but Aveline managed to shoot his carriage and prevent his departure. From him, Aveline finally discovered the identity of the Company Man: Madeleine de L'Isle, her stepmother. Upon returning to Louisiana, Aveline hurried to her family's mansion and confronted her stepmother. Madeleine revealed to Aveline that she had secretly manipulated her life, preparing her for induction into the Templar Order, as she believed that they shared a common goal.

Afterwards, Aveline traveled to the bayou and met with Agaté, informing him of Madeleine's identity as the Company Man. Agaté was unable to accept his failure and believing that Aveline had sided with the Templars, attacked her. Aveline overpowered him and attempted to convince him to leave Louisiana for his own safety, but Agaté could not live with the humiliation and instead chose to dive to his death.

Aveline decided to infiltrate the Templars and eradicate it from within. Upon returning to New Orleans, she made her way to the Saint Louis Cathedral and gave Madeleine Agaté's necklace to show her allegiance. Following this, she was inducted into the Templar Order by her stepmother. Aveline then gave her the two halves of the Prophecy Disk, which Madeleine placed on an altar and added another piece to hold the two fragments together. However, she could not make sense of the scrambled messages within. Aveline saw this as her moment to strike and reclaim the Prophecy Disk. She eliminated all the Templars inside the cathedral and assassinated Madeleine.

Now alone inside the cathedral, Aveline stepped up to the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed. She connected the locket she wore around her neck, which once belonged to her mother, to the artifact, causing it to display a holographic recording detailing a message from the time of the First Civilization. This message recounted the election of Eve as the leader of the rebellion during the Human-First Civilization War.", :release_date => "2014-01-14", :title => "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation HD", :developer => "Ubisoft", :publisher => "Ubisoft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21272-1.jpg')

Lyra's levels primarily involve platforming, stealth and puzzle solving,[3] whilst Iorek's are mainly melee combat based.[4]

A major aspect of the gameplay of Lyra's levels involves the shape-shifting ability of Pan, who has access to four forms; Ermine, Sloth, Hawk and Wildcat, each with its own unique ability. The Ermine's ability is \"Insight\", which allows Lyra to discover information about her surroundings, find hotspots, and unveil secrets. The Sloth's ability is \"Whip\", which allows Lyra to swing from poles and reach areas she cannot simply jump to. The Hawk's ability is \"Glide\", which allows Lyra to glide a short distance, covering gaps she wouldn't be able to any other way. The Wildcat's ability is \"Climb\", which allows Lyra to climb certain surfaces to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Players often have to shift form mid-move. For example, to reach a certain platform, Lyra may need to use the \"Whip\" ability to swing on a pole, and after releasing herself from the pole may need to immediately use the \"Glide\" ability to reach the platform.[5][6][7]

Also important in Lyra's levels are Evasion and Deception minigames. Evasion games occur whenever Lyra is spotted by an enemy and involves button presses to correspond with icons on screen to allow Lyra escape from her pursuer. Deception games are more common and occur regularly throughout her levels. These games take place whenever Lyra is involved in a conversation with someone and is attempting to deceive them. The better the player performs in the minigame, the more successful Lyra is in her deception. The minigames include, but are not limited to, matching symbols, collecting falling icons, avoiding falling icons, a Whac-A-Mole type game and a snooker type game.

Another major aspect of the gameplay is the Alethiometer. Once the player has access to the Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically, some must be sought out by the player. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the handle automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified in the first part of the game, the easier the balancing game is.", :release_date => "2007-12-04", :title => "The Golden Compass", :developer => "Shiny Entertainment", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21281-1.jpg')

The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.[8]

47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown, in order for him to play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie. 47 learns that Dexter is in the \"Terminus\" hotel and after evading Dexter's henchmen, eavesdrops on him. 47 learns from Dexter's conversation with his secretary Layla that he plans to kidnap and auction Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to strangle Sanchez, Dexter's enormous bodyguard, who proceeds to knock 47 unconscious. After Dexter discovers who he is, he almost kills him, but decides as he doesn't want that kind of attention. Just then, a hotel maid comes in and discovers 47, thinking he is dead. Dexter kills her, plants the weapon with 47, douses the room in alcohol, ignites it, and leaves with Layla and Sanchez. Framed by Dexter for the murder, 47 escapes the hotel and evades the police. 47 contacts Birdie, who tells him to go to a local strip club and kill the owner, Dom Osmond, who works as an informant for Blake Dexter, so that he can protect Victoria. 47 kills Osmond and learns from a phone message in his office that Birdie is being hunted by Wade—–a sociopathic mercenary, who is a close friend of Dexter and is under his employ. Despite killing henchmen that were looking for Birdie, Birdie still sells Victoria's location to Wade so that he can save his life. 47 reaches Victoria and learns that the necklace Victoria has keeps her alive. Wade and his henchmen raid the orphanage and massacre most of the nuns. 47 is forced to pick up fuse boxes that are scattered across the orphanage, since the elevator to the basement breaks down. After finding them all, 47 installs the fuse boxes and starts the elevator. Despite 47 's efforts, Victoria is still kidnapped by Wade. 47 manages to shoot Wade, but Victoria is then taken hostage by Lenny, Dexter 's son. 47 interrogates Wade to reveal Victoria 's location—–Hope, South Dakota—–and leaves him to die of his injuries. Meanwhile, Birdie approaches Dexter, offering to broker the ransom of Victoria back to the Agency, but he is rejected. In anger, Birdie secretly provides information about 47 's location to Travis's assistant, Jade, and information about Dexter to 47, hoping to profit off the situation. After arriving in Hope, 47 retrieves his Silverballers after Birdie informs him of their location at a gun store. Later, 47 kills Lenny 's gang and interrogates Lenny himself. The player then drives him to the desert, and the player can either kill him or leave him in the desert. Learning from Lenny that Victoria is at the Dexter Industries HQ, 47 infiltrates the facility and destroys their research data on her while assassinating its scientists, and discovers that Victoria is in fact a genetically engineered clone bred to be a top-class assassin like him; however she can only use the skills of an assassin when she wears her necklace. 47 kills Sanchez in an underground cage fight after learning from him that Victoria was taken back to Hope. Recuperating at a hotel, 47 survives an ICA attack led by The Saints—–elite nuns in leather outfits and kills them.

Infiltrating Hope Courthouse Jail, 47 reaches Victoria but is subdued by the corrupt local sheriff Clive Skurky, who is working with Dexter. The ICA, led by Travis, take over the town in an attempt to get Victoria back and kill 47; but she is nowhere to be found, while 47 escapes the jail and the 'Agency. He then confronts a wounded Skurky in a church, demanding Victoria 's location. Skurky tells 47 she is at Blackwater Park, then dies from his wounds. Travis pays a ransom of ten million dollars for Victoria, but Dexter doesn't keep his side of the bargain and keeps both Victoria and the money. 47 arrives at Dexter 's penthouse and kills Layla after she tries to seduce him (and fails). Dexter, not knowing that Layla has been killed, threatens to destroy the hotel's roof if she doesn't meet him there within five minutes. As Dexter is about to leave the hotel with Victoria and the money by helicopter, 47 mortally wounds him. 47 saves Victoria, while Dexter, with his dying words, apologizes to his Lenny, and asks for his money. Victoria, who is disgusted by Dexter 's words, opens the briefcase containing the ransom and throws the money onto his dying body. 47 and Victoria then leave the hotel. 47 learns from the letter Diana gave to him that Travis created Victoria without the Agency 's knowledge; in the letter, she also requests that 47 kill Travis to protect Victoria. Pursuing him to England, 47 finds the ICA exhuming the Burnwood family graves, believing Diana 's death to have been faked. After killing Jade, and then his personal guards, 47 corners Travis, who asks him if Diana is dead. 47 refuses to answer and kills Travis.[9] During a closing cutscene, 47 watches Diana and Victoria from afar before a message from Diana welcomes him back to the Agency, revealing that the shot 47 fired at her was non-lethal. Victoria also considers disposing of her necklace to prevent her from hurting anyone, with Diana telling her to do what she has to. Another cutscene then shows Birdie offering information on 47 to Cosmo Faulkner, a detective investigating his case.", :release_date => "2012-11-20", :title => "Hitman: Absolution - Professional Edition", :developer => "IO Interactive", :publisher => "Square Enix", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22538-1.png')

All four games are accessible, spectator-friendly, and deeply replayable.

Johann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining.

BaraBariBall is a fighting/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team's side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves. In addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities.

Super Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole.

Hokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.", :release_date => "2014-05-07", :title => "Sportsfriends", :developer => "Die Gute Fabrik", :publisher => "Sony Computer Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23799-1.png')
