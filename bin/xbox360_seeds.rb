As an arcade flight game, it simplifies flight controls and gives the player a large amount of bullets, missiles and other weapons, putting them up against a very large amount of enemy forces. In addition to missiles and a vulcan cannon, the player can equip special weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket launchers, and others. The player can lock on to a number of foes, and assist different tactical squads by switching between their respective HUD readouts.

The game includes 4 default multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, Siege Battle, Team Battle, and Co-Op Battle. In Battle Royale, the basic Deathmatch game mode, up to sixteen players shoot each other down to earn the highest points at the time limit. In Team Battle, a basic Team Deathmatch game is created. Points are awarded based on the type of aircraft destroyed. A unique type of multiplayer game, Siege Battle is played with two teams, Attacking and Defending. The Attacking team attempts to destroy the target (usually heavily defended by flak) within the time limit. The Defending team tries to halt their attack. The co-op battle mode consists of two single-player missions without AI that can be played with up to three other players.", :release_date => "2007-10-23", :title => "Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation", :developer => "Namco", :publisher => "Namco Bandai", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10-1.jpg')

The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own.

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \"Citadel space\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \"First Contact War\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and other destinations.", :release_date => "2007-11-20", :title => "Mass Effect", :developer => "Bioware", :publisher => "Microsoft Game Studios", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7535-1.jpg')

Blazkowitz is the general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. 

He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt.", :release_date => "2009-08-18", :title => "Wolfenstein", :developer => "id Software", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7704-1.jpg')

As in the previous game, the game uses the Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit, an in-world HUD (heads-up display) system that uses holograms projected from Isaac's suit and weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count. In vacuum areas, a timer appears on Isaac's right shoulder, counting how much oxygen his suit has before he suffocates. The RIG also uses gauges on Isaac's back to display his health and stasis module levels. If Isaac's health or air timer reaches zero, or if the player fails to survive a quick-time event, Isaac will die, forcing the player to restart from the last checkpoint.[9]
Early in the game, Isaac acquires the stasis module, which slows down enemies and otherwise-impassable moving obstacles (e.g. active heavy machinery) to allow Isaac to pass through safely; and the kinesis module, which allows Isaac to carry and fire objects telekinetically. The player can upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using power nodes. There are also automated stores, where the player can buy and sell various items, and gain new weapons and suits through acquiring schematics found throughout the Sprawl.[9]
Throughout the game, the player will come across different puzzles that impede progress. In some cases, Isaac must hack consoles to activate machines and open doors; in others, Isaac must repair or reposition mechanisms to proceed. The player regularly encounters zero-G environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering in all directions with thrusters attached to his suit. Both normal and zero-G environments may be in areas within the vacuum of outer space; in these situations, Isaac must refill his limited oxygen supply via oxygen dispensers.[9]
Much like in the first game, Isaac must fight the Necromorphs, organisms that mutate and take control of human corpses. To take down Necromorphs, the player must use \"strategic dismemberment\": in other words, slicing off limbs or sections of the Necromorphs' bodies.[10] For example, shooting a Slasher Necromorph in the head will, like many other types, have little effect; however, it can be stopped by shooting its bladed arms off.[11] Depending on how they are wounded, some Necromorphs, like the Pregnant and the Ubermorph, can adopt new stances and tactics, even sprouting new limbs or spawning more enemies in the process.[12]
Dead Space 2's main campaign offers five difficulty levels (listed in order of difficulty): Casual, Normal, Survivalist, Zealot and Hard Core. Hard Core is unlocked once the game has been completed on any other difficulty. Playable only from a fresh start, Hard Core mode limits the player to three saves in the entire campaign. Item drops and credits are very difficult to find, enemies are very challenging, and checkpoints are absent", :release_date => "2011-01-25", :title => "Dead Space 2", :developer => "Visceral Games", :publisher => "Electronic Arts", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8164-1.jpg')

The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons.", :release_date => "2011-11-11", :title => "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim", :developer => "Bethesda", :publisher => "Bethesda", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8256-1.jpg')

Rather than guns, Green Lanterns use power rings that create whatever the wearer imagines out of green light.

Story
Left 4 Dead 2 is set at roughly the same time as the original – just after the outbreak that turned most of the population into various zombie mutants. Players assume the role of four new \"Survivors,\" each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads these \"Survivors\" through the southeastern region of the US - from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans’ French Quarter.

Gameplay
Just as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. As you would expect in a scenario where you are regularly surrounded by masses of the undead, it is very good thing to have plenty of help, as well as weapons at your disposal, and Left 4 Dead 2 has players covered on both accounts. The game features several multiplayer options including 2-8 player online and offline (via system link) support in several modes seen in the first game, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, as well as the new Scavenge Mode. This new multiplayer option tasks players, in the role of survivors to find a limited number of fuel canisters hidden in a level in order to keep their individual generators going, while other players in the role of the infected try to stop them. In addition the game features very strong co-op play support, with 2-player support locally and 2-4 player support online.

The game features a wealth of melee weapons and additional items handy for battling enemies up-close and personal. Along with melee weapons seen in the first game, players can look forward to wielding new weapons like axes, chainsaws, frying pans, etc. Firearms are also available, but seeing as zombie fighting usually requires a little elbow grease, melee weapons are the mainstay. In addition, players can carry other useful items, including a variety of throwing weapons and several different kinds of support items, like flashlights to startle enemies and light the way in dark environments and healing items like first aid kit and defibrillator kits.

Customize with AI Director 2.0
Introducing the AI Director 2.0, Left 4 Dead 2's dynamic gameplay is taken to the next level by giving the Director the ability to procedurally change weather effects, world objects, and pathways in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match the players' performance. The result is a unique game session custom fitted to provide a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience each time the game is played.

The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the \"figure 8\" shaped course is a staple of the race.

Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.

Edward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.

This is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.

Fire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.", :release_date => "2008-06-24", :title => "Alone in the Dark", :developer => "Eden Games S.A.S.", :publisher => "Atari", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9066-1.jpg')

Many skills are not available directly at the start of the game and have to be unlocked by expending \"learning points\" in the chosen skill. In addition to direct gameplay changes, unlocking skills has other minor aesthetic effects such as the player character using a different stance during combat. The game also has a system for professions and abilities, such as smithing and lock picking which are leveled up in the same way as the weapon skills—by expending points to level up in the specific profession.
Quests conversations are fully logged in a quest diary. Maps are available, along with \"quest maps\" on which objectives are marked. Non-player characters are voiced in English.
Risen has smaller areas that can't be accessed until later. Creatures do not respawn in the first part of the game, but do so in later parts. The island is also said to contain easter eggs.

The Story
In the year 2075, the Earth Defense Force (EDF) received a distress signal from a small mining facility on the surface of Mars. A group of rebels calling themselves the Red Faction had overthrown the ruthless Ultor Corporation after years of oppression. The EDF responded by launching a fleet of warships to Mars to aid the miners, bring Ultor to justice and restore order to the Martian colonies. In order to ensure safety and security for the newly liberated colonists, the EDF set up command posts and bases across the planet. Initially, under the EDF's rule, the people of Mars prospered: colonists established homesteads, built towns and independent mining operations and began to stake and work their mining claims. But the more things change on Mars, the more they stay the same.

The troubles began with colonists being driven from their homes and mining claims by greedy, Earth-based corporations. Then came a 50 year turn of events that saw the EDF adopting the heavy-handed tactics that it once stood against. Yet in doing so it also instilled a deep-seated resentment among the miners and settlers of the Martian colonies. One of these new Martians is miner Alec Mason, whose dream of a new life carved out of the course Martian soil was crushed in the face of EDF-ordered curfews, detention centers, beatings, mass arrests and personal tragedy. But as powerful as the EDF is, there is resistance. Mason and a small group of revolutionaries have banded together, taken up the Red Faction name and pledged to again bring about a free Mars. And though their enemy has changed, their battle cry remains unchanged: \"Better Red than Dead.\"

Key Game Features:

Join the Revolution - When the citizens of Mars can no longer bear the injustice of an oppressive regime, the fate of the planet lies in the hands of Alex Mason and the Red Faction.
Open World Guerilla Warfare - You decide who, when, where and how to battle. Utilize guerilla tactics, improvised weaponry, and modified vehicles to lead insurgent attacks on EDF targets. Launch attacks based on your own gameplay style, take on missions in any order you choose, or engage in destructive activities to weaken the EDF’s grip on Mars.
Geo-Mod Technology 2.0 - Use destruction to your tactical advantage, setting ambushes or chain reaction explosions to attack enemy strongholds and permanently modify the game environment. Leverage fully-dynamic physics-based destruction to improvise on the fly: blow holes in a wall or floor to set an ambush or escape, take out a staircase to stop your pursuers, or drive vehicles through blown out walls.
Evolving & Emergent Gameplay - Carve your path through an ever changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics – mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF.
Epic Sci-fi Setting - Explore the huge, unforgiving Martian landscape, from the desolate mining outpost of Parker to the gleaming EDF capital city of Eos; then tear through the fully destructible open-world environments swarming with EDF forces, Red Faction resistance fighters, and the downtrodden settlers caught in the crossfire.
Multiplayer Combat - There is no place to hide when you put your guerilla warfare skills to the test in a variety of highly destructive 2-16 person online multiplayer combat modes.
Xbox LIVE Support - Build your Xbox 360 gamer score, achievements collection and leaderboard placement through full Xbox LIVE support.
Guerilla Warfare
You don't stand a chance against the EDF using standard military tactics. The only recourse when the few stand against the many is the use of hit and run tactics. Learn the routes of the patrols and quickest ways in and out of EDF strongholds. By studying these things you can instinctively know when to attack, and when to wait for a better opportunity.
Ambushes are also useful in thinning EDF ranks. Remote charges and proximity mines are your best friend when preparing an ambush. A few well-placed charges on the structural supports of a bridge can do wonders for stopping a convoy dead in its tracks. Above all else, remember this: guerilla tactics are not about fighting fair, they are about winning.", :release_date => "2009-06-02", :title => "Red Faction: Guerrilla", :developer => "", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11904-1.jpg')

Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances. Bayonetta still has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the Eyes of the World.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.

The game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option. Microsoft Producer Peter Connelly stated: \"It would've taken a half-day of work, for something that only a tiny percentage of gamers will ever use.\"[citation needed] The player will fight both the Cell, a terrorist organization, and \"Freaks,\" strange infected mutants. Both can be killed with melee attacks, explosions, and bullets but there are special UV weapons made for the Freaks, who can't survive in sunlight. There are 5 skills to be leveled up: Agility, which the player increases by collecting Agility Orbs and Renegade Agility Orbs, by doing Rooftop Races, or by killing enemies from a highly elevated location; Firearms, which is increased by shooting both handheld and mounted guns; Driving, which is increased by running enemies over, power slides, handbrake turns, completing Road Races, jumping through Stunt Rings and collecting Renegade Driving Orbs; Explosives, which is obviously increased by using explosives, both Launchers and thrown Grenades; and last but not least: Strength, which is increased by using hand-to-hand attacks, throwing objects, beating people with those objects, or using the moves you unlock as your Strength increases, such as the Charge or Ground Slam.", :release_date => "2010-07-06", :title => "Crackdown 2", :developer => "Ruffian Games", :publisher => "Microsoft Games Studio", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12062-1.jpg')

In XIII, one of the fal'Cie—a god-like race—transformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the hope that they would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.

XIII-2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.", :release_date => "2012-01-31", :title => "Final Fantasy XIII-2", :developer => "Square-Enix", :publisher => "Square-Enix", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12080-1.jpg')

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.

There's New Trouble on Piñata Island
Unfortunately, not all is well on the island, as Professor Pester and his gang of Ruffians have wiped out Piñata Central's computer records, posing a threat to parties everywhere. Rebuild the computer database and thwart Professor Pester's evil plot by sending piñatas at full candiosity to parties all around the world. Build and maintain your piñata gardens using your creativity and imagination to attract, trap, protect, train, and manage more than 100 different piñata species.

More Ways to Play
While Trouble in Paradise maintains the gameplay mechanics players of the original game will remember, it also adds a few new twists, giving players more choices on how to make their garden grow. These include:

Player Guide System - Replacing the traditional tutorial, the optional Player Guide System directs players through a series of loose goals to help them master the fundamental aspects of the game.

Standard Mode - Presenting a challenge for experienced piñata gardeners and dedicated gamers, the Standard gameplay mode provides a more tricky option, where players must keep a watchful eye on their garden. Sour piñatas, feuding species, weeds, illness and limited money call for you to exercise problem solving and creativity to build and maintain an environment where piñatas can flourish and grow.

Just for Fun Mode - Designed for beginner players, kids and those just looking to explore Piñata Island, this mode allows players to jump into the garden and interact with the unique piñata world. In this mode the difficulty has been turned down and the fun has been turned up. Sour piñatas stay away, resident piñatas remain healthy, weeds don't plague your garden and you have an infinite chocolate coin bank account, allowing you to turn your garden into a veritable utopia of colorful creatures.

Improved Co-Op Play - While the original Viva Piñata had a simple system where two players could mutually control the single game cursor via different controllers, Trouble in Paradise adds drop-in/drop-out offline gameplay for two players and online co-operative gameplay for up to four players. This allows additional players to join the game at any time to assist the primary player with gardening tasks.

Key Features:

Customize Your Garden and Piñatas - Plant flowers, dig ponds, even place sand and snow in your garden to make exotic species of piñata feel at home. Buy objects to change the weather, or get new toys for your piñata. And nurture the thirty-two new species of piñata, including sour piñatas that infiltrate and wreak havoc in the garden. Choose to tame the sours, or feed them candy to keep them sweet.
Play With a Friend - Family members and friends can now share in the joy of creating a garden by plugging in an extra controller. The second player has access to all tools, actions, activities, and can help by collecting magic. It's an entirely new way to play.
Play Multiple Game Modes - Use the Player Guide System to master the fundamental aspects of the game. Then, try the Standard Mode where sour piñatas, feuding species, and limited money call for you to exercise problem solving and creativity to build and maintain your garden. Or enjoy Just for Fun Mode, which allows you to build a garden full of colorful creatures without worries.
Experience Piñata Vision - Plug in an Xbox LIVE Vision camera and interact with the game through the use of printed cards featuring a unique barcode. Flash a piñata card up to the Vision camera, and the content will drop directly into the game.
Show off to friends - Use the new photo mode to snap, print, and upload pictures of your unique garden or customized piñatas to show to friends. Photograph your piñata and turn it into a piñata card, then share it with your friends so they can scan it and put it into their own garden.
Teach Your Piñata Tricks - Piñatas can perform dazzling tricks, if you teach them with the new trick stick tool. Watch as piñatas play together, perch on each other, and interact in new ways to make them even more appealing.
Add Game Content with Piñata Vision
Trouble in Paradise also utilizes the optional Xbox LIVE Vision camera accessory through a feature entitled Piñata Vision. With this players can import, activate, create and share game content via optical card scanning technology. These cards do not necessarily have to be purchased, and instead are primarily downloaded from the game's website. Game developer, Rare, and Microsoft Game Studios are also considering making certain special cards available as part of promotions with magazines or gaming websites, ensuring that fans of the Viva Piñata franchise can expect fresh, exciting for years to come.

Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. Once the playground for the world's wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim to a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The city's ultramodern architecture lies half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course of the game.

While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience \"The Line\", that razor's edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end -- of self and sanity -- when their duty is done and only they remain. 

    Deep, Mature Narrative: The story of Captain Walker's rescue mission will challenge players to make tough choices between what’s moral and what’s necessary, as Walker’s journey pushes him to his very limits.
    
    Blasted Opulence: The events unfold in a stunning, haunting setting – the remains of Dubai, once one of the wealthiest cities on Earth, now stripped bare. Dubai's bold and luxurious architecture still shines through, in spite of the sandstorms threatening all that’s left. Opulent interiors contrast sharply with the vertigo inducing heights and mass destruction outside of the extravagant structures.
    
     Dynamic Sand: Turn the tables on foes by crushing them under a cascade of sand cast down by a strategically placed shot – but beware of oncoming sandstorms and their gale-force winds. The sweeping sands of Dubai feel almost alive, serving as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder the mission, while opening up a variety of new interactions and tactics.
    
     Brutal, In-Your-Face Action: Join forces with intelligent, resourceful squad mates in fever-pitched gun battles. Accessible combat and squad controls will get you in the fight quickly, where you’ll experience the raw destructive force of your authentic weapons as well as engage in extremely physical close-quarters battles.
   
     Endless Multiplayer: In addition to the single-player story mode, Spec Ops: The Line packs a full range of multiplayer features, including a never-before-seen mode with unique connections to the main story, a breadth of competitive and team-based modes, as well as the ability to rank up, personalize, and customize characters from two distinctly different factions.", :release_date => "2012-06-26", :title => "Spec Ops: The Line", :developer => "Yager Entertainment", :publisher => "2K Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12601-1.jpg')

A well-defined main character and a strong narrative provide the structure for mission-based progression through the adventure, but the sandbox-style game world allows players to explore and interact as they wish, moving from town to town through the harsh wilderness on horseback, by stagecoach, or on a train. Throughout their travels, players can hunt and skin wild animals, gamble, capture bounties, engage in duels, search for treasure, and help those in need.

The game is built on the same Rockstar software engine that runs Grand Theft Auto IV, and the user-directed action-adventure playing style is similar to that of GTA4 as well, although the setting is very different. More of a successor than a direct sequel to 2004's Red Dead Revolver, Redemption puts players in control of a former outlaw looking to make good. John Marston is on a mission to bring an old ally to justice, and perhaps to bring a little law and order to the outposts and boomtowns he passes through along the way. Marston once rode with a gang of outlaws who robbed trains, held folks for ransom, and killed nearly anyone who got in their way, to take whatever they wanted. Now, as part of a bargain to protect his own family back home, he must use his violent skill set to apprehend or gun down a former partner called Bill Williamson -- a bandit at least as ruthless and deadly as Marston ever was.

With evidence mounting, the city begins to lose faith in the detective, and gamers must prove his innocence by examining crime scenes, collecting evidence, questioning suspects, and using his famed deduction skills.

Xbox 360 gamers can switch between first- and third-person views as they explore the city freely, choosing which leads to follow and which to ignore, and even reenacting crimes to determine a suspect's guilt or innocence.

The game takes place during the late 13th century, in the pre-dawn of the Enlightenment. Its story follows two unlikely companions: a French Templar Knight and a young noblewoman who has been accused of heresy and driven from her homeland.

Single players can control either one of the characters, allowing the computer to control the other and switching between the two to access the most useful skills from one situation to the next. In the game's two-player drop-in cooperative mode, each player controls a character, working together to battle enemies and solve environmental puzzles. The characters grow more powerful with experience, as players custom-develop them up a branching skill tree.

Weaving through themes of justice, conspiracy, and the secrets of the Holy Grail, the narrative calls on players to contemplate their actions in context, as even the most righteous cause may be carried out in a gruesome and unscrupulous manner.

The game begins as Batman delivers the Joker to Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. The villain springs a trap and takes over the institution, with an army of thugs and a host of dangerous inmates to back him up. The twisted plot plays out in a freely explored re-creation of the asylum and surrounding island. In addition to prowling the corridors of Arkham, Batman can explore the outdoor areas, using his equipment to reach high spots and glide safely back down.

Specially suited for the game's one-against-many melee style, the three-button combat control scheme is intended for free-flowing moves and strings of combo attacks on multiple opponents. Batman also has a belt full of useful gadgets to help even the odds, with x-ray scanners and chemical tracers that let him see through walls and follow invisible tracks. Stealthy prowling gives advantages of positioning and surprise, rewarding the hero's caution and patience with one-hit takedowns. Experience earned through combat, exploration, and experimentation allow Batman to create better equipment, more finely tuned to the given tasks.

In addition to the Joker and his brilliant aide in evil, Harley Quinn, Batman faces other super-powered asylum patients, including Bane, Killer Croc, and Zsasz. As usual, brains as well as brawn are required to unravel Joker's insanely inspired scheme. The story for Batman: Arkham Asylum was written by Paul Dini, writer and producer for Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond. Cartoon series regulars Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin perform voice acting. The game was developed by Rocksteady Studios, creator of Eidos' 2006 first-person shooter Urban Chaos: Riot Response.

Along with the full game and all features of the original release, the Game of the Year Edition of Arkam Asylum supports three-dimensional effects using the TriOviz-brand stereoscopic technology, and ships with two pair of special glasses for use with the game. The 3D technology can be used on any conventional television set or monitor and does not require any additional equipment.

Leading in from earlier Operation Flashpoint briefings, threats from the People's Liberation Army play a significant role as the game's narrative develops, but much of the game takes place to the north and west, along the banks of the Vakhsh, known as the \"Red River\" to the people who live there.

Players take the roles of deadly xenomorph aliens, stealthy predators, and heavily armed space marines, to do battle with enemies from the other two factions. Evolved to protect the brood, the alien xenomorphs are unmatched in melee combat, and excel at surprise attacks with their overpowering strength. Born of a species of hunters, the predator is a master of well-timed assaults and agile attacks. Physically weak but at a technological advantage, the human marines use heavy firepower to take down enemies from a distance. In many of the game's levels, warriors from all three factions must fight against one another in the same battles, at the same time.

Players will have to fight hard to survive, but it pays to fight smart, as well. In some situations, characters can manipulate the environment, or accomplish other puzzle-solving feats, in order to put their enemies at a disadvantage.

Set between the second and third Saw films, Flesh & Blood puts players in the shoes of Michael, son of the first game's protagonist Detective David Tapp, as he looks for clues as to his father's death and becomes the latest target of Jigsaw and his strange apprentice Pighead II. The gameplay once again mixes heavy doses of survival horror and puzzle-solving with mild combat elements, as players attempt to help themselves, and others, out of life-and-death situations by successfully completing mini-games and quick-time events. The combat comes in two forms, with gamers using melee attacks and a variety of weapons in physical battles against Jigsaw's thugs, or executing puzzle-based attacks that make use of traps and environmental hazards. Various case files are strewn about the hotels, factories, and sewers in which the game is set, and players can also collect a number of Billy the Puppet dolls hidden throughout each level.

Rowling's extraordinarily popular book series. In terms of play style, Half-Blood Prince is similar to its immediate predecessor, Order of the Phoenix. Players are free to explore Hogwarts, the sprawling arcane academy, where they will find discovery points, in key locations, that activate quests and challenges which can reveal plot information and move the story forward. 

Players can enter into wizard duels and play Quidditch in the game, and as in the book, the powerful effects of both custom-brewed potions and teenage romance can have heavy influence over the way events unfold. Half-Blood Prince features a day-night cycle, allowing players to sneak out after sundown and complete missions that might raise suspicion in the light of day. In addition to duels with students from other Hogwarts houses, players will face off against dangerous opponents such as Death Eaters and Inferi. As Gryffindor's star seeker, players will also compete for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. Following the story of the book, mini-games allow players to try their hand at mixing potions, using recipes from the old, annotated textbook of the mysterious Half Blood Prince.", :release_date => "2009-06-30", :title => "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", :developer => "EA Bright Light", :publisher => "Warner Bros.

The resulting pandemonium finds players controlling Deckard through the midst of a three-sided conflict between rival secret societies and beasts such as werewolves, minotaurs, gryphons, and golems. The Council of 98 and the Black Order both seek the power of Pandora's box for different reasons, while the monsters attack everyone and wreak havoc on the destructible environments.

Having been marked with The Signet, denoting that only he can re-seal Pandora's box, Deckard must travel from New York to London, and on to Durham, England, to restore peace to the world. The Signet allows him to draw health from fallen creatures and perform an attack that repels all nearby foes, but he must rely on grabbing ammunition from dead soldiers, and his weapons are standard pistols, shotguns, and rifles.

Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as strikingly attractive as ever.

Lady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however, and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental puzzle-solving, and third-person shooting found in the blockbuster originals.

While the storyline of Tomb Raider: Legend is told around the series' traditional \"tomb raiding\" action, Lara must also adventure through modern city levels, proving her acrobatic skill set is as applicable to skyscrapers and cement as it is to unforgiving wilderness and ancient architecture. New equipment, such as the grappling hook and communication device, offer new abilities. A number of vehicles become available along the way, as well, for special gameplay sequences.

For the first time in the series, stalwart Eidos studio Crystal Dynamics (Gex, Legacy of Kain, Project: Snowblind) was developer of this Tomb Raider game, instead of the franchise's creator, Core. The designers at Crystal Dynamics have endeavored to apply their extensive experience in the 3D action genre toward reinvigorating one of gaming's most recognizable and beloved characters.", :release_date => "2006-04-11", :title => "Tomb Raider: Legend", :developer => "Crystal Dynamics, Inc., Crystal Dynamics", :publisher => "Eidos Interactive", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12898-1.jpg')

Developers strove to create a smooth-moving, contextually integrated character. Motion-capture technology is used for the first time in the series, with the 3D recordings of a world-class gymnast bringing Lara's jumps, flips, and kicks to life. In all, Lara's movement throughout the game incorporates over 2,000 animations. 

It takes a god's weapon to kill a god. Lara is set on a quest to obtain the power of Mjöllnir, the hammer of the invincible Thor.

These points help the player progress through the career, purchase more cars and parts and earn more fans for the user base.

Fable II expands upon the scope and depth of the original by adding incredible new features and creating a wider, more complex kingdom of limitless choices and consequences. Players will have the option to play as a man or woman, get married, have children, and live a life of their own design -- all leading to different destinies.

Fable 2 Platinum Hits contains the Knothole Island and See the Future game add-ons. In Knothole Island you will embark on new adventures, fight new creatures and find Albion's rarest weapons, clothes and potions. You will also be able to check your standing in over 50 new Leaderboards on Lionhead.com. In See the Future, heed the call for a hero to restore color and balance to the world, or let Albion fall to the wayside. Those who emerge victorious will receive the ultimate reward - a quest that provides a vision of Albion's future and what lies ahead for those born into the heroic bloodline.

Special features


A land far, far away. Gamers will revisit the newly expanded world of Albion more than 500 years after the events of the original “Fable,” where they are free to explore the landscape and openly roam the countryside. For the right price, every house, hut, dungeon and castle is for sale. Players can witness how the world grows and changes in response to their decisions in incredible and unique ways as they rediscover Albion as if for the first time.
Fight with ease. “Fable II” pioneers a new combat system designed to allow players to truly master hand weapons such as swords and maces, ranged combat weapons such as crossbows and guns, and an entirely new magic system. These three disciplines, while very accessible, are also amazingly deep, and allow players to mix combat styles and become everything from master swordsman to skilled ranger to evil magic wielder, each using a different single button on the Xbox 360 Controller.
A hero’s best friend. This groundbreaking addition to the game is integral to the theme of unconditional love in “Fable II.” A player’s canine companion will act as friend, compass and protector. Players must merely feed their pooch and he will love unconditionally, creating a bond that sets up emotion-filled journeys throughout this magical world.
Experience the world together. For the first time in the “Fable” series, gamers can experience the expansive and immersive world of “Fable II” with friends, either on the same couch or over Xbox LIVE together in co-operative mode.2 “Fable II” embodies the new Xbox experience and will extend the Xbox LIVE service further with the introduction of orbs. Orbs allow for seamless LIVE co-op play and interaction with other “Fable II” players. 
Xbox LIVE Arcade “Fable II” Pub Games earn major gold. Lionhead Studios is providing an unparalleled experience to gamers through Xbox LIVE Arcade. Gamers can start earning in-game currency for the “Fable II” world in August 2008, before the game’s release to retail, by downloading and playing an Xbox LIVE Arcade title, which contains three casino-style minigames titled “Fortune’s Tower,” “Keystone” and “Spinnerbox.” Gamers can win items such as dog tricks, potions and chocolates; unlock 15 pieces of concept art; and use the gold earned to purchase weapons, armor and more in “Fable II.” This is a first-of-its-kind experience for gamers that can only be found on Xbox LIVE Arcade.

Much like in Oblivion and Gothic 3, the gameplay is non-linear. The player is free to explore the game world, accepting side quests at will. There is however, a core quest, centering around rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the god of fire.

The game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches.

The world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted.

Death in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.
There are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated.

Beyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests. However, the path chosen will have consequences on the outcome of the game.", :release_date => "2007-08-24", :title => "Two Worlds", :developer => "Reality Pump", :publisher => "SouthPeak Interactive", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13269-1.jpg')

Tecmo Koei's long-running 3D fighting series, known for its fast-paced action and occasionally titillating visuals, returns to gamers with destructible stages, perilous new danger zones, and new critical attacks in Dead or Alive 5. Combat takes a rock-paper-scissors form, with players executing throw-beating strikes, hold-beating throws, and strike-beating holds, with properly deflected attacks resulting in high-damage counters. Landing specific moves leaves opponents in a Critical Stun state, which prevents blocking and can lead to devastating Critical Combos and Power Blows.

There are more than a dozen characters from which to choose, with fights occurring in places like a downtown construction area, a war-torn desert city, and a circus, among other locations. Xbox 360 gamers battle as the world crumbles around them, flinging foes into Danger Zones to inflict massive damage and cause buildings to collapse, helicopters to crashes, and oil tanks to explode. Some of the stages include upper and lower levels, allowing for new \"Cliffhanger\" action sequences in which one combatant dangles from the edge of the upper level. Multiplayer fans can take on friends in local or online action.", :release_date => "2012-09-25", :title => "Dead or Alive 5", :developer => "", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13295-1.jpg')

Unlike other shooters, Gears of War is all about teamwork in a big way. All game modes, levels and scenarios are designed specifically to encourage co-operative play, whether it be with A.I. partners or human players (with A.I. teammates designed with specific strengths, weaknesses and personalities.) On top of that, voice recognition will be available for players, and obviously voice chat to discuss strategy with your friends. In addition to voice chat, gamers will be able to experience individualized matchmaking, view player statistics, earn player achievements, customize their games, and build and personalize their gamer profiles over Xbox Live.


Gears of War 2 continues the story of Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad, locked in an increasingly desperate battle against the nightmarish Locust Horde for the survival of humanity. The game promises to be an epic saga of survival, loss, and retribution. Just as Gears of War set the standard for high-definition visuals, Gears of War 2 raises the bar even further with the amazing technological advances of Unreal Engine 3, delivering a bigger, badder, and more intense experience as the story continues.

Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

Both co-op and competitive modes are included for up to four players, and there are multiple difficulty settings as well as a practice mode. In addition to the soundtrack from the Wii version, the Xbox 360 game includes a number of exclusive tracks, from \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" to \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\" The Walmart Exclusive edition includes the bonus track \"Another Part of Me.\"", :release_date => "2011-04-12", :title => "Michael Jackson: The Experience", :developer => "Ubisoft", :publisher => "Ubisoft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13478-1.jpg')

Dead Island features an open-world environment in a campaign that supports up to four players for drop-in, drop-out cooperative action.

Experience points earned in combat can be used to improve a character's attributes and fighting skills.

When firearms and ammo are in limited supply, you'll be able to engage enemies in hand-to-hand combat with axes, machetes, knives, clubs, and similar edged or bludgeoning weapons that will degrade over time. Explore the island's urban areas, forests, mountain highlands, caves, beaches, and other locales from a first-person perspective, or utilize an over-the-shoulder view for melee combat.

EA's football coach simulator heads back to the gridiron in NFL Head Coach 09. With gameplay more akin to European-style \"Soccer Manager\" games than the Madden NFL franchise from which it spawned, the original NFL Head Coach generally received lukewarm reviews from critics. But after a one-year hiatus -- during which it presumably did a little TV and work spent some quality time with the family -- the franchise returns with a new focus on depth and realism. Once again the coach's livelihood depends on his approval rating, and everything gamers do, from win/loss record, to going for it on fourth down, to choosing whether to yell at the QB after a bad interception, will affect approval rating. 

Key personnel decisions have been given an added sense of urgency with the new Live Event feature, which puts all trade, free agency, coaching, and contract negotiations up against a running timer. As in real life, the draft is the centerpiece of the NFL offseason, and gamers can prepare by scouting players in college all-star games, at the NFL combine, and during pro-day and individual workouts. Meanwhile, players can get running commentary on the lives and college careers of more than 20,000 unique draft prospects from NFL Network personality Adam Schefter. Other additions intended to increase realism include: Non-drafted free agent rookies, 75-man preseason rosters, trades involving future draft picks, a new wear and tear injury system, and 300 new sideline animations. 

NFL Head Coach 09's online features allow gamers to upload created plays and download, rate, or view any play available. Two players can also go head-to-head in a quick test of coaching acumen. Offline, gamers can adjust their plays in the middle of a game and save the new formations, or create entire playbooks using the coach clipboard user interface. All created plays can then be exported and used in Madden NFL 09. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide", :release_date => "2008-09-02", :title => "NFL Head Coach 09", :developer => "EA Tiburon", :publisher => "EA Sports", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13607-1.jpg')

As the developer's first 2D fighter developed for high-definition systems, BlazBlue features fast, anime-inspired fighting action, which plays out over detailed, multi-layered backgrounds, with flashy, sometimes psychedelic visual effects for special attacks and big hits. The fighting takes on a certain rhythm, as there is a split second pause after each hit, giving players who can catch on to the cadence a chance to use the brief freezes to time their next move or counterattack. The action is very fast, and without the stuttering pauses, few humans could hope to keep up. Each character has a special \"drive\" attack move, which is difficult to perform, but devastating if used correctly. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as \"the Library,\" which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. The game's developer declared BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger to be the \"spiritual successor\" to the Guilty Gear series.

From a familiar third-person perspective, players resume the single-player role of Batman, for missions of infiltration, assault, recovery, and rescue. Gruesomely outnumbered, the hero's survival still relies largely on stealthy ninja tactics, although open environments occasionally call for cape-aided hang-gliding or grappling-hook acrobatics.

Although the territory of the new Arkham City is nearly five times larger than the old asylum grounds, Batman's path is sometimes limited by outbursts of gang warfare, usually best avoided. The game also regularly presents puzzles for the Dark Knight to solve, in the gadget-enhanced \"Detective Mode.\" The combat system has been refined, allowing Batman to counter attacks from multiple opponents at once, and to access his gadgets in the middle of a fight.

Set only a year after the events of Arkham Asylum, the game's story begins with Quincy Sharp, the former warden who is now mayor of Gotham City. His plan -- to shut down the asylum, move the inmates to a walled in section of city slums, and hire private security to guard the new borders -- has created a zone of pure lawlessness in the heart of Gotham. It is a city within a city, where inmates are free to roam the streets, stealing and killing as they wish, so long as they do not attempt to escape.

Control of this urban wasteland is now contested by two rival gangs: one led by the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, and the other by Two Face, who has called for the public execution of Catwoman, much to the delight of the other bloodthirsty residents. Side-stories involve more of Arkham's most famously devious and demented recidivists, including Mr. Freeze, the Penguin, Poison Ivy, and the Riddler. Kevin Conroy again voices Batman, with Mark Hamill as the Joker.

This \"Game of the Year Edition\" offers Xbox 360 players the full original game, the newly released \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" DLC, and a variety of other DLC packs, adding seven new maps, three playable characters, and 12 new skins in all.", :release_date => "2012-05-29", :title => "Batman: Arkham City: Game of the Year Edition", :developer => "Rocksteady Studios", :publisher => "Warner Bros.

Banjo must complete LOG's challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster.

By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, players both young and old are rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in their quest to defeat Grunty once and for all.

It was released alongside the DLC release of The Ballad of Gay Tony on October 29 2009 for the Xbox 360 and released on April 13 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3.
 
Unlike the downloadable versions of the episodes, the compilation does not require a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV to play, nor is an Xbox Live or PlayStation Network account necessary (except for multiplayer). The content is also played straight from the disc, and does not need to be installed on a hard drive to play, like various other disc-based expansions for other Xbox 360 games that have been released in the past. Available exclusively on the Episodes from Liberty City disc are three new in-game radio stations – Vice City FM, RamJam FM and Self-Actualization FM.[", :release_date => "2009-10-29", :title => "Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City", :developer => "Rockstar North", :publisher => "Rockstar Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14238-1.jpg')

There is a combination of new school and old school pros (Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and Tony Hawk himself) and the soundtrack is half classic THPS tracks and fresh ones.

In the near future, cyborg technology has become commonplace throughout society. Three years have passed since the collapse of the Patriots system that had been secretly controlling the global power balance from the shadows. However, peace remains elusive. The dissemination of cybernetic technology has triggered instability and conflict as those who control the trade gain increasing power. Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will. As a member of the peace-keeping PMC 'Maverick Security', Raiden lives by the mantra of protecting and saving lives.

To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.

The player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint's self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food.

In line with the contemporary film productions, the 2010 game's storyline follows the first portion of the final novel in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. From a third-person 3D perspective, players explore perilous scenes detailed in the book, and engage in action-oriented battle using powerful blasts from their magic wands. Xbox 360 gamers with the Kinect camera-control system can also cast spells simply by waving their hands in magical patterns. Two players can team up in cooperative multiplayer, taking the roles of any of the three main characters. The video game adventure is set away from the familiar school grounds for the first time, following Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a run for their lives from the forces of Voldemort, who has come to control the governing Ministry of Magic, as well as the once-safe Hogwarts academy.

Guiding the three young heroes, players travel to remote and dangerous locations in a desperate quest to destroy the Horcruxes, objects of great power that are the secret to Voldemort's immortality. Different objectives and battles are best won by using the various special abilities of each character, calling on them to work together to overcome each series of challenges. No longer mere students, sheltered from the dangers of the world of magic by Professor Dumbledore and their other wise and kind teachers, Harry and his friends must face ferocious monsters, grim Death Eaters, and powerful rival wizards who have allied with the Dark One. The game also features magical battles against monsters and villains from earlier Harry Potter books, offering players a chance to further hone their wand-wielding skills. The dangers of the Deathly Hallows are greater than any he has faced before, but surviving this first part of the final adventure is the only way to prepare \"The Boy Who Lived\" to meet his destiny, in an inevitable showdown against Voldemort when the story comes to its conclusion.", :release_date => "2010-11-16", :title => "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1", :developer => "EA Bright Light", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15654-1.jpg')

The player's GM is rated on eight disciplines including North American scouting, international scouting, pro-league scouting, player development, trades, contract negotiation, owner confidence and leadership. GMs also have former career backgrounds (i.e. ex-manager, lawyer, business person, former player, or talent scout) that affect the GM's disciplines. A GM's ratings improve or regress over his career depending on their performance and will have seasonal goals depending on the club they're hired by. The player will be faced with decisions such as spring training evaluation, initiate and respond to trades, develop rookies, and even bid for Japanese baseball players.

Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009's Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all.

As with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape.

Returning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks.

The heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress. An optional subscription service entitled \"Call of Duty Elite\" will allow players to track detailed statistics such as win-loss records, kill-death ratios, time played, most successful maps, favorite weapons, and much more.

Hardened Edition bonus items include a Steelbook case, collectible field journal, special ops juggernaut outfit for your Xbox Live avatar, premium membership to Call of Duty Elite, and special founder status on Call of Duty Elite. Call of Duty Elite's premium membership includes all future downloadable content (DLC) for Modern Warfare 3, of which there are 20 pieces of DLC expected within the first nine months following the game's release.", :release_date => "2011-11-08", :title => "Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Hardened Edition", :developer => "Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16162-1.jpg')

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team.

Anointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.

Since the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.

A behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.", :release_date => "2006-11-21", :title => "Gears of War Limited Collector's Edition", :developer => "Epic Games", :publisher => "Microsoft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16163-1.jpg')

The game combines role-playing with strategy and puzzle elements. It uses a competitive Bejeweled-style playfield to simulate combat and other activities common to role-playing games.

The game was first published simultaneously for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in early 2007, and several ports to other systems were subsequently announced. The Xbox Live Arcade version was released on 10 October 2007.[6] The Wii version came out on 29 November 2007. The retail version for Windows came out on 22 October 2007, although the downloadable PC version was available as of 10 October 2007. A version for PlayStation 2 was released on 13 November 2007, and was followed by a mobile version for cell phones in early 2008. It was released for PlayStation 3 on 9 October 2008 through the PlayStation Network, and for the iPhone OS through the App Store on 23 December 2008.

On 16 November 2007, at Game Connect, a conference for Australian game developers, lead designer Steve Fawkner announced that Infinite Interactive is working on a free, web-based game that will tie-in with Puzzle Quest and the developer's future titles.

Ushering in a new era for the franchise with cutting-edge technology powered by the Fox Engine, MGSV: The Phantom Pain, will provide players a first-rate gaming experience as they are offered tactical freedom to carry out open-world missions.


Taking place nine years after the events of MGSV: Ground Zeroes and the fall of Mother Base, Snake a.k.a. Big Boss, awakes from a near decade-long coma. The game resumes the story in 1984, with the Cold War still as the backdrop, which continues to shape a global crisis. Snake’s journey takes him into a world where he is driven by a need for revenge and the pursuit of a shadow group, XOF.


Hideo Kojima, head of Kojima Productions, continues to ambitiously explore mature themes such as the psychology of warfare and the atrocities that result from those that engage in its vicious cycle. One of the most anticipated games of the year with its open-world design, photorealistic visual fidelity and feature-rich game design, MGSV: The Phantom Pain will leave its mark as one of the hallmarks in the gaming industry for its cinematic storytelling, heavy themes, and immersive tactical gameplay.


Key Features:

-	Open-World game design allowing players ultimate freedom on how to approach missions and overall game progression 

-	Fox Engine delivers photorealistic graphics, thoughtful game design and true new-generation game production quality

-	Online connectivity that carries the experience beyond the consoles to other devices to augment the overall functionality and access to the game", :release_date => "2015-06-30", :title => "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain", :developer => "Kojima Productions", :publisher => "Konami", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16717-1.jpg')

Players can create and control numerous units from a strategic command perspective or one unit on the field from a third-person action perspective.[4][5] They can also command fixed emplacements that they create such as howitzers, mortars and machine guns, or drive various vehicles such as tanks, biplanes and bombers. When the player takes control of a single unit, the other emplacements are automatically controlled by artificial intelligence. When shot, the toy soldiers explode into plastic chunks but do not display blood, in order to keep the game family-friendly.[5]
A tower defense-style single-player campaign is available, which involves defending a base from British or German soldiers.[4][5] The player receives money for destroying enemies, which can be used to equip greater defenses. The single-player game features British and German campaigns among 24 unique levels. Once a campaign is finished, the player unlocks Survival Mode, which involves fighting continuous streams of enemies to last as long as possible. There are four difficulty settings.[5] Multiplayer is also available (Xbox only), and can be played online over Xbox LIVE or locally with two-player split-screen.[4] In multiplayer games, the player must focus on waging offensives as well as defending the base.

This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish a surveillance state. This, in turn, leads to a small group of rebels forming under the name \"Errorists\": their mission is to bring down Memorize.

Set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, The Bureau tells the origin story of the clandestine XCOM organization's first encounter with a mysterious and devastating enemy. Originally established as America's covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic.

In the spirit of the XCOM franchise, The Bureau's calculated combat design requires players to think and act tactically.

Thankfully, you're not alone in your struggles on the Battlefield. The bonds with your teammates will grow stronger as you face perils of every kind. Don't let your squad down; they're counting on you as much as you need them to survive.

In Battlefield 4 you'll engage in both close quarters squad-based combat and in vast battles commandeering tanks, jeeps, jets, helicopters and naval units. Utilize high-tech gadgets, a wide variety of weapons, and the dynamic environment itself as the climactic story progresses.

Battlefield 4 takes the fight to many urban environments like the outskirts of Baku and the skyscrapers of Shanghai, all of which become explosive, dynamic playgrounds for the Tombstone Squad.

Whether you're riding the waves of the South China Sea or traversing Shanghai's iconic Huangpu River, naval warfare is central in Battlefield 4's single player campaign.

Player AI has been massively upgraded, with players running intelligently into space when not in possession of the ball and pointing where they want the pass placed to continue the attack. Similarly, the physical side of play has been refined, with players working to turn a defender as they receive the ball, while defenders must learn to stand off slightly to prevent such moves.
Series creator Shingo `Seabass` Takatsuka has also worked to refine the shooting system of the new game, and players will be able to attempt more snap shots than in previous versions, while volleys and half-volleys have been redesigned. Other new moves include the ability to retain control of the ball when sliding in to tackle, while all-new feints and backwards dribbling are now available thanks to the improved dribbling controls, while headers have been changed to allow players more movement in the way their strikers jump and head the ball.

Pro Evolution Soccer 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Details on official club teams and more national squads will follow.

Other new additions include more balanced referees, and a selection of exciting new gameplay modes. An International Challenge involves leading your home country to victory through a series of entry and tournament rounds, while a Random mode lets the player play quick games within randomly-generated match day settings. The much-loved Master League also returns, allowing players to experience the many highs and lows of steering a team through years of competitive games.

As Spidey, players will be able to free-roam through a greatly-enhanced Manhattan cityscape, one set to offer livelier, more engaging opportunities with which to put his sensational skills to use.

This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves \"The Divine Ones\", began conquering nations one after another. \"The Chosen People\" carried out these conquests in \"the name of peace\".

Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (森羅?).
Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.

The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (天内?) with the help of Kazamori (風守?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the \"Sword of Acala\", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.", :release_date => "2008-04-09", :title => "Ikaruga", :developer => "Treasure", :publisher => "Microsoft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20136-1.jpg')

At character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4.

This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra.

\"In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new,\" Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity.

\"Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!\"

There are a couple of ways to get Ultra, due out in June on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in August on PC.

If you have Super Street Fighter 4 or Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition you can download Ultra Street Fighter 4 as a £10.99 / €14.99 / $14.99 digital upgrade for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in early June. The PC digital upgrade and the PC full digital bundle will both be available in August 2014.

Also in August the PS3 and Xbox 360 retail versions and full download version of the game will be released for £29.99 / €39.99 / $39.99.

Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about.

Nostalgia has the side effect of high expectations though, and Jet Set Radio HD just can't meet them. While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game.", :release_date => "2013-07-03", :title => "Jet Set Radio HD", :developer => "Sega", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21266-1.jpg')

Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.

Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.", :release_date => "2014-09-30", :title => "Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor", :developer => "Monolith Productions", :publisher => "Warner Bros.

Six years later, anomalies are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Godwin Longhener dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.

Nevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their \"enslavement\" (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past rather than in the present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: \"Start over from the past... I never thought of that\", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.

And once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal: the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are awaiting...

However, an evil genius, Dr. Wily, plots for world domination and creates his own robot army to take over mankind. Luckily for humanity, Dr. Light outfits one of his domestic robots \"Rock\" to fight Dr. Wily's creations. Mega Man is born.

Set after the events of Mega Man 8, multiple riots have sprung up all over the world. Whilst many people suspect that this is another plot from Dr. Wily, Dr. Light is stunned to recognize that some of the robots rioting on the TV screen are his own creations. Even more stunning, Dr. Wily appears on television to proclaim that Dr. Light is the evil mastermind behind these latest catastrophic incidents and it's up to Mega Man to clear his creator's name!", :release_date => "2008-10-01", :title => "Mega Man 9", :developer => "Inti Creates", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24050-1.jpg')
