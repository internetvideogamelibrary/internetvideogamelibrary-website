After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package.

The package is a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are tunneling to Zion with an army of Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense. During this operation, Niobe and Ghost provide backup to another group of operatives trying to escape.

With everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in. Niobe and Ghost help the humans escape; when everyone is safe except them, the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, leads them to safety through a door that he created.

The Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo, the protagonist of the film trilogy. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix. As Niobe and Ghost pursue them, the character that the player did not choose is captured by more henchmen. Before the player character rescues the one captured, the Merovingian destroys the key that the Keymaker gave them.

The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun.

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.

For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.

Each character has several different skills based on their mutant powers. These include melee, boost, projectile, traps, and others. Each character can also learn powerful super skill: for example, Cyclops has a super beam attack that can hit multiple targets; Wolverine has a spinning attack that inflicts heavy damage; Magneto has a metal attack, crushing everything in sight by manipulating metal objects in the environment, etc.", :release_date => "2005-09-20", :title => "X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse", :developer => "Raven", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5445-1.jpg')

This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.

There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other.

In contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific \"Ratio.\" Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in Arcade Mode with the Ratio System removed.
Unlike the first game, which was based on The King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, and the SNK characters have been tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha. However, a number of different fighting styles called 'Grooves', which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called \"Subsystems.\" There are six in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game.

It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear.

The game's story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.

Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you.

BloodRayne's primary mission will take her to an underground temple in South America, where it is rumored an elite group is trying to unite three parts of an ancient talisman to control the world.

To fight her, the supernatural enemies will plan ambushes or call for reinforcements if the odds are not in their favor.

As BloodRayne becomes more proficient at killing, her abilities will increase as well. Talents include speed, agility, vision, and the ability to slow time to attack multiple enemies at once.

Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way past a diverse selection of five themed areas consisting of indoor and outdoor locales. I-Ninja is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask to cover his watermelon-shaped head, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, runs up walls and ramps, hops on a barrel to cross narrow ledges, and avoids numerous hazards while slicing at enemies. Other weapons include shurikens, swords, blowguns, rocket launchers, homing missiles, and more, with bosses and lesser villains appearing in the air, sea, and on the ground. Players will even square off against a 150-foot robot from inside a robot warrior of their own. The ultimate goal is to defeat nemesis Master O-Dor and his army of Ranx foot soldiers. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with over-the-top animations, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.


I-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills.

Instead of exploring labyrinthine caverns from within an underground mining colony on Mars, players roam futuristic cities on Earth. An evil dictator named Sopot has condemned the player's character (Alias) to death, along with a handful of other soldiers, for inciting a rebellion. It doesn't take long before the group breaks free, thus beginning the arduous task of reclaiming Earth's freedom from a totalitarian regime. 

Attempting to prevent this from happening are armies of cyborg soldiers, spider mines, sentry droids, and other enemies, but players have an advantage missing from the first game: five brothers-in-arms fighting as a team. The teammates, Tangier, Repta, Quill, Shrike, and squad leader Molov, each demonstrate distinct abilities and personalities as they fight. Quill is a quiet soldier who is an expert sniper, for example, while Shrike is a rowdy braggart. The soldiers are automatically under computer control, so players do not have to worry about issuing commands or planning out intricate strategies. 

The situation dictates what each teammate will do in a particular mission. Sometimes a squad member will drive one of the several different vehicles and aircraft as players provide the firepower, while other times they will follow and offer cover fire. The Geo-Mod engine from the first game is present in this version as well, allowing players to destroy buildings and shape the terrain using an assortment of high-powered weapons, including submachine guns, assault rifles, and grenade launchers. Veteran actor Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Millennium) provides the voice of Molov, and up to four players can battle each other on a split screen.

Originally developed for the PlayStation 2 by Volition, this GameCube port was handled by THQ's internal development team at Cranky Pants Games. Enhancements made over the PlayStation 2 version include higher texture resolutions and more color in the environments, custom animations, and special lighting effects for more visual flair. The storyline, modes of play, and features are otherwise the same.


Red Faction II is the sequel to the popular first person shooter, Red Faction, which debuted on the PC and PS2 in 2001. Red Faction II is run on an enhanced version of Volition's Geo-Mod engine and incorporates an in-depth storyline. Players will go on multi-objective mission with a whole arsenal of weapons and items at their disposal. Players are able to control a variety of vehicles and fight with elite squad members at their side. Red Faction II introduces refined graphics, advanced AI, customizable computer opponents for multiplayer and even new multiplayer game modes.", :release_date => "2003-04-01", :title => "Red Faction II", :developer => "Cranky Pants Games", :publisher => "THQ", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12936-1.jpg')

He is transported to another dimension and transformed into a lizard himself. The enemy army is strong and diverse, however, with different mutant lizard soldier types that are well suited for various tasks.

Luckily, after transforming from a boy into a lizard, changing from one lizard form to another eventually becomes relatively easy, and Scaler will need to assume the appearance and abilities of no fewer than five other lizard-like creatures in order to accomplish all the objectives before him. 

Since certain goals can only be reached in one particular lizard form, part of the challenge can be figuring out which shape to take in each situation. Nevertheless, whether they realize it or not, all the good people of universe are depending on Scaler to prevent the impending mutant lizard uprising.

In addition to riding across real-world locales, players can participate in side events like bus jumping, wheelies, and zipping through tunnels of fire to earn some notoriety and cash for their character. Money can then be used to purchase new equipment including bikes, clothing, accessories, and more.

Nine professional riders are available to play as or against, including such legends as Kris \"The Rock\" Rourke and Ronnie \"Kung Fu\" Faisst. Seven generic riders are also selectable, bringing the total lineup of characters to 16. Players must guide these characters through various skill-based challenges in order to unlock the remaining courses. Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.

Freestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball. Those tired of the existing courses can create their own arena using the built-in level editor.

Bravo Team is sent to investigate a series of grisly murders in the Arklay Mountains region outside of Raccoon City. On the way to the scene, the team's helicopter is sabotaged and crash lands in the forest. The team discovers an overturned military police transport truck and the mutilated corpses of two officers. After the team splits up, field medic Rebecca Chambers finds a zombie-infested train stopped in the middle of the forest. After a little exploration, she teams up with former Marine Billy Coen, a man the military police were escorting to his execution, and the two explore the remaining train compartments, combating zombies, swarms of strange leeches and a mutated scorpion. As the train begins speeding out of control towards a cliff, the two manage to apply the brakes and divert its course towards an abandoned research and training center.
The pair investigate the underground facility, facing off against the Umbrella Corporation's experiments: mutated insects, spiders and primates. They discover that the former operator of the facility, Dr. James Marcus, along with Ozwell E. Spencer and Edward Ashford, discovered the Progenitor virus, a strain of which causes rapid mutations when combined with the ebola virus. Ashford originally wanted to use the virus to help the handicapped through its regenerative effects, but after his death, Spencer and Marcus began research on its applications for bio-weapons, combining it with leech DNA which eventually led to the formation of the infectious T-virus, causing the zombie outbreak. After a showdown with a gigantic bat inside a church, Billy is attacked by a T-virus infected primate and becomes lost inside an underground laboratory.
While searching for him, Rebecca meets Bravo Team captain Enrico Marini. He tells Rebecca about \"an old mansion which Umbrella uses for research\" not far from the facility. Rebecca declines Enrico's offer to follow him there, instead deciding to continue her search for Billy, eventually finding him washed up on a walkway. After fighting the Tyrant together, the two eventually meet Marcus and discover that he caused the outbreak. Marcus had operated the facility until his assassination by two of Umbrella's prominent scientists (acting under Spencer's orders). During his dying moments, his pet queen leech had entered his body and reproduced exponentially over ten years, absorbing his DNA and memories and bringing him back to life. Marcus proceeds to split into a mass of leeches, before chasing Rebecca and Billy through the facility. As the Queen Leech, Rebecca, and Billy continue to fight, the facility's self-destruct mechanism is activated. After being injured due to a brief exposure to sunlight, the monster is paralyzed when the overhead entrance to the laboratory is opened just as the sun rises. Rebecca throws Billy a Magnum and he delivers the final shot to the Queen Leech.
As the facility crumbles, the two escape into the forest and come to a halt on a cliff overlooking the Spencer estate. They salute one another after Rebecca declares Billy \"officially dead.\" Each goes their own way, with Rebecca heading towards the mansion to investigate the whereabouts of Bravo Team.", :release_date => "2002-11-12", :title => "Resident Evil Zero Player's Choice", :developer => "Capcom Production Studio 3", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18555-1.jpg')

Players will need to outfit themselves with the tools of the trade from body armor and over 14 weapons, to silencers to make the \"hit\".", :release_date => "2004-09-28", :title => "Trigger Man", :developer => "Point of View", :publisher => "Crave Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18711-1.png')
