There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items.

The Captain eventually uncovers secret plans for a WEC space station, the Vigilance Platform, which can attack any location on Earth from space, meaning cities with a known Resistance presence can simply be annihilated at the leisure of the WEC. All such cities are threatened with orbital bombardment unless they surrender. Concurrently, the player's Resistance cell is betrayed from within, and almost all the non-player characters are killed. Despite these setbacks, the Captain infiltrates the Vigilance Platform and destroys it.

You take the role of Cornet in the game. She's a young woman who lost her parents at a young age and possesses a strange ability to talk to and control puppets. With that rather unique mix, Cornet is a rather independent and strong-willed person despite her youth. Her quest intitially involves meeting the prince she first encountered in the forest, but it quickly develops into a much broader quest once her beloved prince is kidnapped under strange circumstances.

Battling through the game will take Cornet to all corners of the kingdom. She'll make friends, face enemies and encounter betrayals throughout the course of her adventure. With multiple dungeons and many boss creatures, she'll have to build up a force of puppet friends to tackle this quest properly. She'll encounter potential puppet allies almost everywhere; graveyards, ancient ruins and even unwanted junk can make for some potentially valuable allies.

Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.

Much of Xenogears plot and backstory is detailed in the Japanese-only book Xenogears Perfect Works. This book, produced by the now defunct DigiCube, details the history of the Xenogears universe from the discovery of the Zohar to the start of the game.[8][9] According to the Perfect Works schematic (as well as the game's end credits), Xenogears is the fifth episode in a series of six.

Xenogears follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey to uncover the truth behind mysterious, cabalistic entities operating in their world. The principles and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Jacques Lacan influence the plot, character design, and world of Xenogears. Additionally, the symbols, theological concepts, and devotional practices of several world religions are represented in fictionalized forms in the game. Major psychological themes are the nature of identity and human memory, particularly as these relate to the phenomenon of dissociative identity disorder.

Money Idol Exchanger is a stacking game similar to the Magical Drop, Astro Pop, and Puzzle Bobble series whereby players race to prevent a perpetually falling array of coins in different values from filling up the screen. Coins are combined (vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher valued coins; for example, five '1' coins will form a '5' coin, and two '5' coins will form a '10' coin, and so on, until two '500' coins are put together, at which point both disappear. Coins are arranged and colored to match denominations of the yen coins. Two bonus tiles allow for changes in gameplay. A green RU tile will rank up all coins of the same denomination; for example, all '10' coins will become '50' coins. A blue ER title will erase all coins of the same value. The game is won when any coin reaches the bottom of the opponent's screen.

In the single player mode, one of two characters can be selected who attempt to beat up to seven idiosyncratically named characters with names like Debtmiser, Mightdealer, Eldylabor, and Cherrybeiter. In the two player mode, both players fight each other until victory. The quicker and more efficiently each player clears out their screen, the quicker the other player's screen will fill up. Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly.

There is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible.", :release_date => "1998-11-05", :title => "Money Idol Exchanger", :developer => "Face", :publisher => "Athena", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25704-1.jpg')

The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.

However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.

Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions.

At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers.

Initially released in Japan in January 1997, the game was later ported to the PlayStation in June 1999, with an English version of the game appearing on the platform in North America in the following September by SCEA, and later in Europe in March 2001 by Ubisoft. The game was produced by much of the same staff who worked on the company's previous role-playing endeavor, the Lunar series, including producer Yoichi Miyagi and music composer Noriyuki Iwadare.

Since its release, Grandia has become notable for its combat mechanics which have been carried over to future games within the franchise, and has spawned two spin-off titles - Grandia: Digital Museum and Grandia: Parallel Trippers - both released exclusively in Japan. In celebration of the announcement of renewing development on Grandia Online, which acts as a prequel to Grandia, the game was re-released on Sony's PlayStation Network platform in Japan as a downloadable title in April 2009 and in North America on February 25, 2010. It was re-released in Europe on November 10, 2010.

The game is set in a fantasy world of emerging technology and exploration. A young boy named Justin inherits a magic stone that leads him on a journey around the world to uncover the mystery of a long-lost civilization. Along the way, he meets other adventurers who join him on his quest, which draws the attention of the militaristic Garlyle Forces who seek to uncover the secrets of the past as well. Grandia received a largely positive critical response during its original release, and was voted by readers of Japan's highly circulated Famitsu magazine as the 73rd greatest game of all time in a 2006 poll.", :release_date => "1999-09-30", :title => "Grandia", :developer => "Game Arts", :publisher => "Sony Computer Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8510-1.jpg')

Wild 9 is a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, featuring gameplay similar in vein to the company's Earthworm Jim games. Unique to the game is the The Rig, a weapon the protagonist wields.

The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.

It is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.

Depending on personal preference, players now have the opportunity to drive around circular tracks in a NASCAR fashion or race at breakneck speeds in an Indy car circuit.

Andretti Racing comes with a variety of options including the Exhibition Race, Career, Versus, and Racing School gameplay modes. The Exhibition Race is simply a single race using either racing type. It is designed to not only save players the hassle of starting an actual Career mode, but to get them accustomed to the various racing controls.

In addition to this practice of sorts, new players interested in mastering or learning the sport should check out the Racing School. Featuring the help of Mario Andretti, Michael Andretti, and Jeff Andretti, the Racing School is a series of instructional videos that outlines the sport and gives inside information on how individual Formula-1 and stock cars are put together.

When you're ready to tackle a full season of racing, the Career mode throws you into the mix of either racing circuit. After registering your name and selecting your vehicle of choice, you'll enter a ten-week season of fierce competition. Not only is the competition designed and taken from real-life racecar drivers, each opponent features realistic AI. These guys are at the top of their game...are you?

The season will take players through realistically modeled locations including the Calder Park Thunderdome, Vallejo Speedway, Grand Rapids Motorsports Complex, and the Oceanside International Raceway; track schedules and locations differ between racing types. Each track differs in its own unique way (distances, laps) requiring practice and skill to learn and memorize.

If you're being lapped and coming in last place, it's time to adjust the dynamics of your vehicle! Andretti Racing allows players to customize car transmissions, select from a variety of tires including soft and slicks, adjust the front/rear wing and downforce velocities, and change gear ratios. By customizing your vehicle to optimum performance, you'll have better control and consequently finish higher up in the leader board.

Additionally, Andretti Racing features the first ever PlayStation split-screen mode with a link cable compatibility; up to four players can play via two consoles! It also comes with a variety of damage, control, and in-game camera options.

Just about everything you can think of can be manipulated here, right down to the volume of the floor toms, the amount of reverb applied to each instrument, and the song's tempo. The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing. Once you have your complete package, you can save everything to a memory card and access any part of it (from an instrument sound or keyboard riff to the entire song) later.

The player views the environment from the perspective of the character (first person view) and moves the character through the environment with the controller. At the same time, if the player wishes to attack an enemy or destroy an object, they press a button which allows them to control a crosshair on the screen. This crosshair can be moved to any location within the main character's line of sight. Using the G-Con 45, players move around by shooting off screen to move and the side buttons to turn, and point at the screen to shoot enemies.
The game borrows its enemies from Resident Evil 2, featuring the zombie models from that game, as well as creatures such as Lickers, the Ivy plants, Moth Giants and Tyrants. In addition, Survivor also reintroduces the original Hunters from the first Resident Evil and features two new enemies in the form of the Umbrella Trashsweeper unit – soldiers armed with machine guns – and the Hypnos T-Type, a new Tyrant model that evolves into different forms. The player's arsenal consists almost entirely of pistols, such as the Glock 17 and the CZ75. As the protagonist progresses through the game, the player receives larger weapons to aid in defending against ever more dangerous opposition while they make their way through Umbrella's ruined city and shadowy research labs.

The research on the mysterious Third Energy is being continued in secret, but then an entire island with the facility conducting this research and a neighbouring town has vanished, moving back in time to the dinosaur era. A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. 

Dino Crisis 2 is a survival horror game in which you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3D models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. 

Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose \"vitality\", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. 

For each killed dinosaur you receive \"Extinction Points\". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in \"Save Shops\" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and \"tools\" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or \"cards\" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. 

While wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including \"Dino Files\", which contain a flavor description of a dino species.", :release_date => "2000-11-02", :title => "Dino Crisis 2", :developer => "Capcom", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10752-1.jpg')

Unlike Resident Evil for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game, instead, it is more of a slight remix.

There are three gameplay modes available. \"Original\" contains the original game with no changes or additions. \"Beginner\" features double the amount of ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature.

\"Arrange\" mode is the \"Director's Cut\" version of the original. The default outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are introduced, and the placement of key items is changed. Most of these changes are designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first Resident Evil - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew. The default Beretta pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill standard zombies in one shot.

The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen. Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from Western releases. However, only the French and German releases contained this footage. U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video shipped with the original release. This has never been corrected, either in the Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation Network.

The original issue of the Director's Cut contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on a second disc. The \"Greatest Hits\" re-release added Dual Shock support for the controller (left \"movement\" stick only).", :release_date => "1997-09-25", :title => "Resident Evil: Directors Cut", :developer => "Capcom", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10772-1.jpg')

Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. 

The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. 

Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.", :release_date => "1995-09-01", :title => "Battle Arena Toshinden", :developer => "Tamsoft", :publisher => "Takara", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10954-2.jpg')

The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win).

Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team.

The crime element is not the only thing you have to deal with -- you'll also cross narrow ledges, avoid obstacles and pitfalls, and even fight on top of a speeding subway train. To accomplish these feats, you must learn how to punch, kick, jump, grab and throw multiple opponents. You also need to climb ladders, open doors, pick up objects (using some as weapons), and hang on ledges or jump off walls. Sound familiar?

In addition to the ability to push around objects, you can flip tables and chairs, causing damage to nearby enemies. Other pick-ups let your character heal (rice, milk or take-out-boxes) while others are important for your quest (red and gold dragons and extra takes).

An onscreen compass allows players to determine in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad.

As Ivan Popovich you'll need to guide your Steel Cossack Powersuit through five different zones, rescuing hostages and dispatching the various enemies and Sentients that stand in your way. Belying the fact that you're in control of a large mech of sorts, the game moves very quickly and is more reminiscent of a first-person shooter than of something like MechWarrior. Armed initially with only basic machine guns, rockets, and a \"scythe beam\" special weapon, Ivan must eradicate the enemy presence within each zone, rescue a quota of hostages, and ultimately destroy the zone generator before proceeding. The various drones that populate each level serve as little more than an annoyance but by destroying them, human prisoners can be set free and Energy Cores can be acquired. The latter can be used to purchase weapon and armor upgrades between levels, giving the player access to salvos of guided missiles, plasma cannons, and an assortment of special weapons with foreboding names like \"Medusa\" or \"Vortex Bomb.\"

Ivan's main task, however, is to engage and destroy the Sentients, which can be attacked in any order the player desires. Letting too much time elapse between these battles will cause the Black Knight appear; a deadly, heavily armored mech who must then be defeated before Ivan may continue with his mission. Additional power-ups can be found in each zone that will refill your gun, missile, or special weapon reserves, as well as provide abilities such as invulnerability or a speed increase.

Of course, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 features the \"Plastosheen\" dynamic lighting effects familiar to fans of the earlier games in the series. The title also includes a variety of new weapons that are instrumental in carrying out missions for the lantern-jawed Sarge, including shotguns, grenades, and flamethrowers.

Beware Brigitte Bleu, the beautiful but deadly spy working for nemesis General Plastro.

Since you can't replenish the ammo for the extra weapons, you'll have to take your shots carefully. The environments you'll battle in include real-world outdoor settings and indoor \"alternate world\" locales that include a giant bathroom, garden, sandbox, kitchen, and living room.

Army Men: World War - Final Front is another chapter in the popular Army Men series from 3DO, and the sequel to Army Men: World War - Land Sea and Air.

The single-player game takes players through five different campaign, each set in a different global location and each with their own specific objectives. The soldier has a host of weapons to fight off the enemy soldiers and vehicles, armaments ranging from rifles and bazookas to flame throwers. He'll also be able to procure vehicles himself. Players will pilot tanks, jeeps, cargo trucks, motorcycles, and submarines in their quest to destroy the enemy supply and weapon lines.

It seems some sort of agency is threatening the general welfare of the country, and it is up to you to thwart its diabolical plans.

In order to stop the enemy, you'll take to the skies in your trusty aircraft (a combination of the YF-23, X-31, and the F-111). Like Air Combat, there are various missions to conquer (over six in all). There are stealth missions requiring you to avoid radar, bombing, and missile raids, and straight-up dogfights. Resistance comes in the form of other aircraft, sea cruisers, ground turrets, and missiles.

Your plane has the ability to detect enemies on radar, fire various missile weapons, and cloak itself from radar (very handy for those stealth missions). In order to survive, each feature must be utilized and learned by the player. Certain objectives require the use of heat-seeking missiles and strategy. If you go in with guns and missiles blazing, in all likelihood, you'll get shot out of the sky.", :release_date => "1995-11-21", :title => "Agile Warrior F-111X", :developer => "Black Ops Entertaiment", :publisher => "Virgin Interactive", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12158-1.jpg')

The game can be played three different ways: Puzzle mode, Battle mode, and Arcade mode. In the Puzzle mode, you must travel to one of seven different courses and construct specific size buildings. You must not destroy the buildings in this mode. The object is to build cities for the specific course or region you're in and make the cities grow.", :release_date => "2000-07-12", :title => "Builder's Block", :developer => "Taito", :publisher => "Jaleco", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12218-1.jpg')

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.

While the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.

Bubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

Bust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor.", :release_date => "1999-02-28", :title => "Bust-a-Move '99", :developer => "Taito", :publisher => "Acclaim", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12220-1.jpg')

Based on a cult TV show in Japan where contestants have to guide a rod in between two barriers of pulsating volts of electricity to the end of the maze without touching either side as this will lead to a shock of electricity, you would hardly even conceive this idea to be a practical videogame.

The game entails moving around what appears to be a dot on the screen since this actually represents the stick in a 3D world that is viewed from \"top down\" on the head of the rod. By directing this rod through the maze without hitting either of the barriers, you will take victory. However speed also must be taken into consideration since a time limit is established for each course. Players can also change speeds by simply pressing the X button to drop down a speed or circle to speed up with a total of five speeds available. The unlimited number of mazes are set through various background courses and obstacles from spinning blades, poker machines and even a metal robot.", :release_date => "1999-02-03", :title => "Irritating Stick", :developer => "Saurus", :publisher => "Jaleco", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12713-1.jpg')

Talk to the people of the Discworld (a flat world on which Ankh Morpork lies), though most are useless because they're all mad.

Two different modes allow you to try your hand at both ultra-realistic driving simulation, and arcade-style racing with brutal crashes and fast-paced, forgiving action. Each car has eight technical settings that can be tweaked to your taste, or you can just trust the judgment of the mechanic. Try out Solo mode; Time Attack (a race against your own best time); World Championship; Split-Screen Duel; and the helpful Driving School mode. Awesome graphics and true-to-life F-1 physics make this the most harrowing racing game to date, and impressive computer AI will have you working at this beast for quite awhile.", :release_date => "2000-10-11", :title => "F1 Racing Championship", :developer => "Video System", :publisher => "Ubi Soft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12980-1.jpg')

An overhead perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while still being able to see everything around them.

The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of warriors.

In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over 30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13 Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.

Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new \"master.\" As one of four intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb Throwers and Death).

To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally invulnerable Death).", :release_date => "2000-02-29", :title => "Gauntlet Legends", :developer => "Midway", :publisher => "Midway", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13227-1.jpg')

While no special modes of play exist, there are tracks and boats to be unlocked. Hydro Thunder allows players access to three boats and three tracks at the start of the game. New boats will be released depending on your finish on each of the three tracks. A player must finish in one of the top three positions on each track for new boats to become available. Boats each have their own advantages in areas such as control, stability, and speed.

Tracks are released in the same way as boats. A top three finish in each of the first three available tracks is needed in order to unlock new tracks. On the new tracks a top two finish will be required and so on. No difficulty settings are featured in Hydro Thunder but when new tracks are released they will contain an increased difficulty level. The first three tracks are considered easy, the next three medium, and the three after that hard.", :release_date => "2000-02-29", :title => "Hydro Thunder", :developer => "Blue Shift", :publisher => "Midway", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13251-1.jpg')

One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette \"Angel\" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the game).

The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.

Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen \"steps,\" even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode.", :release_date => "2003-05-01", :title => "Turnabout", :developer => "ArtDink", :publisher => "Natsume", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13440-1.jpg')

Every player is also modeled as closely as possible after their real life counterpart, even down to their own batting stances and pitching styles. Brand new animations such as arguments with umpires, high-fives, end-of-game celebrations and player reactions to strikeouts and homers also help bring the game to life.

Gamers who really want to immerse themselves in the experience can try out the brand new Behind the Fielder view. Now they can put themselves in the shoes of a fielder and see how easy it is to snare a line drive or scoop up a tough grounder. Perhaps they'll even stop yelling during real games every time the home team makes an error.

As an added bonus, EA has secured exclusive rights to the 500 Home Run Club, which means that gamers can step up to the plate as Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron or others, and take on today's top pitchers like Pedro Martinez or Randy Johnson. In addition, EA has exclusive rights to the MLBPA Big League Challenge, which is set in Las Vegas' Cashman Field.

She needs 5000 dollars in 30 days to save the business or else the children will be left homeless.

Each day represents one activity, which is selected by stopping Moe's hand as it moves across a series of colored spaces.

Other spaces include Banker, which means the Stooges spend the day losing ten percent of their cash or receiving a nasty comment; Money, which offers a random amount of cash; and Question Mark, which could result in either a windfall of money or a visit from I. Fleecem.

The majority of spaces are jobs in the form of mini-games. Curly tries to scoop up as many crackers as possible with a spoon, the Stooges race across a hospital in tiny racecars, Larry runs across a sidewalk to find a song before Curly loses a boxing match, and the trio, dressed as waiters, sling pies at their guests as quickly as possible.

The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.", :release_date => "2001-06-14", :title => "Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends", :developer => "Red Lemon Studios", :publisher => "Ubi Soft", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13634-1.jpg')

Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.

As a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.

Armed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.

In Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.", :release_date => "2000-08-21", :title => "Countdown Vampires", :developer => "K2", :publisher => "Bandai", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14158-1.png')

Hellnight is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the \"creature\" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.", :release_date => "1998-01-20", :title => "Dark Messiah", :developer => "Atlus", :publisher => "Atlus", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14458-1.jpg')

You will have to clear the land, build roads, railroads, power plants and necessary infrastructure, zone the building areas, levy taxes, control crime, juggle budgets, deal with natural disasters and much more...

Unlike many games, SimCity 2000 doesn't have one specific goal or 'winning' scenario (unless in the scenario mode). The game supplies you with the tools to design build and manage your cities (as well as the people in them) -- what you choose to do with those tools is up to you. The three main options available to you are pre-set scenarios, explore and modify the default cities already provided or build your own cities from the ground up.

As you begin you can select to play the Mayor's Boot Camp practice session. Here you can test out gameplay, controls and navigation to prepare yourself for the tasks ahead. The game uses toolbars with icons for all building and management features.

This compilation includes the classic games: 

- Konami's Boxing (1984):
A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option. 

- Konami's Ping-Pong (1985):
From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin. 

- Hyper Sports 2 (1985):
Three tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one. 

- Mopiranger (1985):
The peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in... 

- Antarctic Adventure (1984):
As a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards. 

- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984):
Based on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy. 

- Road Fighter (1985):
A top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out. Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery... 

- Sky Jaguar (1984):
Vertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious Zephyr army, the planet's only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky Jaguars. It 'll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the Zephyrians' unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and destroy the enemy's hidden headquarters? 

- Gradius (1986):
The people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. 

- Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988):
Also known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.

Throughout the planet of Arrakis (a desert-like planet riddled with dunes and sand), three military powers have engaged in a fierce war to control a most prized resource known as the Spice Melange. The mysterious spice can only be found on the planet of Arrakis; every race in the known universe lusts for its power.

With all the bickering and fighting over Spice Melange, the Emperor has issued a challenge that basically states whoever controls the substance will control Arrakis. The three aforementioned forces include the noble House Atreides, the wicked House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic House Ordos. Not only does each house desire control, they also have different reasons for entering the war.

The House Atreides loathes and fears the evil forces of the Harkonnen and wishes to form an alliance with the Fremen, strange sand-dwelling warriors that inhabit the bowels of the planet. The nobles function much like a normal army, giving commands for the side of good. On the other hand, House Harkonnen is run by a tyrannical baron that demands victory. These blood-drinking savages enjoy battles and chaos more than the actual victory; they reign with widespread fear. House Ordos is a bit more unorthodox than their warring brethren. Led by cyborg-like officers, they go into battle with a strategic mentality and play for the odds. Gut feelings aren't acceptable in their society. Having arrived with Lady Alara on the desertous Arrakis, she has enlisted you as a commander of one of the three military powers. Her sisterhood is hoping that you will be victorious with that house above all others, as to create a clear faction in control of the Spice Melange in which her Order could form an alliance.

After selecting the house of your liking, a commander will give you a military briefing and objective. As a 3D real-time strategy game, you'll begin by constructing a series of battle units, important housing structures (walls, construction yards, barracks, outposts) and vehicles; this is vital in order to meet the mission objective. You'll start the scenario with a power supply for building a Spice Melange refinery to generate money. Afterwards, it's up to you to build a fully operational base. Upon completion of the necessary structures, it's time to attack your opposition! You'll command and control a wide variety of light infantry soldiers, troopers, saboteurs, and the aforementioned Fremen.

Other choices include the pandas, the moais, and a set of business suit-clad dogs. 

You're given a small map with limited resources - the object is to capture factories so you have the ability to make more units, which include a huge variety of tanks, planes and boats. Like Final Fantasy Tactics, the terrain is 3D modeled but the sprites are 2D. When you attack an opposing enemy, you get a goofy little (voiced) cutscene where your characters fight and taunt each other - they're pretty amusing, but can be skipped if you just want to play. There's even a cat who occasionally pops in to give some commentary on the battle situation. 

For a game that seems this lighthearted, there's an incredible amount of depth. Not only do you create vehicles, but you also have a vast array of unique characters to command each unit - also with their own stats. Unfortunately, at this point it all becomes a little overwhelming. Throughout the game, there are over seventy units, and while some have wacky names like \"Gaba Gaba Mk 3\", \"Go Go Saber\" and \"Mig-800DX!?\", others have more generic titles like \"Pu-25\", \"SM1573\" and \"T-Back 34/85\".

Cleons, the king of the country Regenburg, offers his general Gizarov a reward for his achievements on the battle field. For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...

The game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.

The story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe. 

The game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...

Langrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.", :release_date => "1999-01-28", :title => "Langrisser IV & V: Final Edition", :developer => "Masaya", :publisher => "NCS Corporation", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18786-1.jpg')

The easiest way to describe Slap Happy Rhythm Busters (or Srap Happy Rhythm Busters, based off the English spine label on the CD) is \"Jet Set Radio: The Fighting Game\". It draws from the same hip youth oriented Shibuya aesthetics. It has a hip, electronic soundtrack. It even uses a similar style of cel-shaded graphics, a true rarity for PSOne games. (The only other notable one is the dreaded Simpsons Wrestling.) It is not a ripoff, because it was released in Japan at approximately the same time. It's also a surprisingly decent game from a company not exactly synonymous with quality. Polygon Magic was most known (if one could say \"known\" at all) for the Galerians series, but they also made a few forgettable fighters - Fighters' Impact for the arcades, Lord of Fist and Vs. for the PSOne, and later went on to do Bleach: Shattered Blade for the Wii. In that context, it's surprising that Slap Happy Rhythm Busters manages to couple a pretty decent game along with its brightly attractive visuals.

Slap Happy Rhythm Busters is largely about style. The visuals are fantastic and the cel-shaded characters look phenomenal. The solid color designs make it easy to hit their low polygon count, one of the biggest problems with PSOne-era 3D fighters.

Battles require four points to win and features include special launches, shifting paths (based on the spinning top's parameters), special attacks, gimmicks (special powers inherent in some parts), and growth (to a maximum level of 19).

Taking on the role of a magician on a magic carpet, you’ll run through around 50 levels, killing stuff with magic and then collecting its “mana.” Collect enough mana and the next level is opened up. 

The stuff being killed is not defenceless though – far from it. Enemies range from relatively harmless vultures, right through to swarms of undead, firespitting dragons and titanic wyverns. There’s also other mages to contend with – in some levels as many as seven - and that’s where the toughest challenges are at.

Each mage possesses a castle. As long as the castle exists, the mage has a spawning point should he/ she die. The castle is upgradable provided the mage has collected enough mana, so levels quickly fall into a rhythm that is split evenly between fighting the wildlife to collect mana, protecting your own castle, and then attacking your “human” opponents.

So far it probably all sounds pretty standard, but Magic Carpet has a host of ideas that work so well, the game still remains relevant today. The maps are reasonably small (by today’s standards), but they really are open – each map is filled with secrets and dangers to find and avoid. The levels are also morphable – it is possible to destroy environments as it was possible to create volcanoes and gaping chasms.

There is also a huge range of spells to collect and use – 24 in total – ranging from standard shield and health regeneration, through to more aggressive fireballs and the awesome destructive might of meteors.", :release_date => "1996-03-01", :title => "Magic Carpet", :developer => "Bullfrog", :publisher => "Electronic Arts", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20192-1.jpg')

There are ten levels and three difficulty modes: Beginner, Medium, and Herculean. The last two levels are playable only on Medium and Herculean difficulties. There are three rush levels in the game in which the player must run forward through the map and avoid obstacles without being able to stop or fight. The player's health is measured in the energy bar shown in the upper left corner for normal levels or bottom left for rush levels. The energy bar can be increased by picking up Hercules Action Figures and the energy can be replenished by drinking Herculade cups found throughout the game. The player's main weapon is the sword, although he can also punch, but this is a much more difficult way to defeat enemies. Weapon powerups, known as Gifts of the Gods, can be found throughout the game, consisting of the Lightning Sword (shoots lightning any direction Hercules aims when selected and fired), Fireball Sword (shoots fireballs that seek out onscreen enemies when selected and fired), and the Sonic Sword (affects enemy targets at close range with a circular sonic blast when selected and fired). There is also an invincibility powerup, found in the game in the form of a helmet, which grants the player a few seconds of invulnerability when activated. Powerups have limited action, and once their energy has depleted, they can no longer be used. In many levels, there will be hidden letters that if all collected, will form the word HERCULES and will allow the player to spawn directly at the next level, instead of starting the game all over from the beginning. There are also four hidden vases in each mission, that upon collection, will give the player a secret password for the current level, which he can later use at the game start screen to spawn at the level from which the vases were collected. During the game, the player will face many bosses, most of which can't be defeated by conventional fighting and require the player to perform special actions to pass. Among the enemies that Hercules will face are: Nessus the Centaur, the Minotaur, the Harpies, the Hydra, the Gorgon, and Hades. Several Titans and a Cyclops also appear in the game, but the player does not fight them directly.", :release_date => "1997-06-12", :title => "Hercule", :developer => "Disney", :publisher => "Sony", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20990-1.jpg')

Take an exciting ride across the USA for your chance to compete in the big race and win hoards of cash. But watch out for the police car on your tail. Packed with more features than your local multiplex, Big Race USA brings a whole new dimension of mind-boggling realism to your PlayStation.

If you've always wanted a pinball machine but just didn't have the money, you'll be delighted at the real-life pinball physics now available on the PlayStation. The PRO PINBALL series strikes again, this time with an auto-themed trek across the country. All of the realistic touches of arcade pinball are present from the bumpers right down to the click of the flippers. You can adjust the camera three different ways to view the table from any angle you desire, and you can even take a gander at a pre-game slideshow that details the table's layout. It's easy to change the table rules, switch the screen position, tweak the graphics and sound, and choose a difficulty level: Extra Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, or Extra Hard. There's also a custom difficulty level that allows you to adjust any of the game's settings to provide extra challenges or assistance for yourself. Add in magnetic ball saving, multiball, and other bonuses and you've got yourself one heck of a cross-country journey. Pinball wizards and videogamers alike will revel in the thorough attention to detail and creativity in PRO PINBALL: Big Race USA.", :release_date => "2000-07-25", :title => "Pro Pinball: Big Race USA", :developer => "Cunning Development", :publisher => "Empire Interactive", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21553-1.jpg')

It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious \"American\" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray S.K. is not present in the game).

The game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.

The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \"emotion\" to the 3d player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.

The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1994 - the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the \"Rest of the World\" section (they were in Football League 1 at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004).", :release_date => "1999-10-26", :title => "FIFA 2000", :developer => "EA Sports", :publisher => "Electronic Arts", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22622-1.jpg')

Although popular enough for numerous installments, This Is Football has always trailed in sales to EA's FIFA series and Konami's International Superstar Soccer and Pro Evolution Soccer series, although it has been suggested that this is due to the much larger marketing spend on \"FIFA\" and \"Pro-Evo\".

Although chiefly just an update from the 2001 version, the game did prove to be quite a stepping stone from the LMA of old and the LMA seen today.

The first PlayStation 2 incarnation went under the same name when released in April 2002. A significant update from PS1, it allowed players to manage in one of six European leagues, all of which were processed by the game simultaneously (the top two divisions in Italy, Spain, Germany and France were added, in addition to the existing top four divisions in England and Scotland). On the PS2, matches played out in full in a 3D match environment, followed by post-match highlights voiced by famous BBC presenter Gary Lineker alongside the returning Hansen. The game play advanced in this game from the 2001 version, in particular the in-match style.

STORY: 
Welcome to the world of Rakugaki. An imaginary game world, created entirely by the pencil drawings of the \"God Hand\". The characters who inhabit this world were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the \"Heroes Team\", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. 

Called the \"Heroes and Enemies\", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... 

GAMEPLAY: 
Rakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as \"pick up, aim & throw\". In Rakugaki Showtime different \"drives\" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a \"Forward Drive Throw\", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a \"Backward Drive Throw\", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. 

By performing a \"Counter\", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you \"Counter\" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a \"Donpisha Counter\" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. 

One of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of \"halleluja\" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their \"Super Smiley Attack\", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. 

Like every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. 

Around the stages are \"Item Points\", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a \"Homing Dash\". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a \"Homing Dash\" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to \"Chain Homing Dashes\", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. 

GAME MODES: 
- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. 
- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. 
- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. 

CHARACTERS: 
- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. 
- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly \"light-weight\" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. 
- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. 
- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as \"OYAJI\", which is somewhat Japanese slang for \"My Old Man\", \"Geezer\", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your pushing against or with the way he's staggering.", :release_date => "1999-07-29", :title => "Rakugaki Showtime", :developer => "Treasure", :publisher => "Enix", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23756-1.jpg')

You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story. 

Bastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes. 

In Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren. 

Bastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers. 

In the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. 

The story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense. 

Manufacturer's description: 

Hagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG. And the battle system with a highly strategic position is reflected in the war situation and the compatibility of the character. Dark Schneider is working with the hero lost memory, to return to the real world back memories, let our adventure with friends.

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate. 

- TwinBee (1986):
(aka Stinger) Save Professor Cinnamon! When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two Twinbee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy! In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back. In the two-player mode, Twinbee (cyan craft) and Winbee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join \"hand-to-hand\" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots. 

- Gradius 2 (1987):
Gradius 2 is a side scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship.

Continuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on \"yon\", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun.

The gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.

STORY: 
Satan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!", :release_date => "1999-12-16", :title => "Puyo Puyo~n - Car-kun to Issho", :developer => "Compile", :publisher => "Compile", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25834-1.jpg')

Also added were several \"Omake\" stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character.

Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device to take over the world by changing history. Reika Kirishima (霧島零香?), the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.

The player uses a joystick and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted portions of the background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of the cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time.

That later changes to Ippo's path towards the Japanese Featherweight Championship and eventually the world championship.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn.

This compilation includes the classic games:

- Konami's Tennis (1984):
Released in 1984, Konami's Tennis plays much like Atari's Realsports Tennis but with ladies instead of men. The game can be played by one player against the CPU, two player singles or two player doubles. A referee in the tower tells whether the ball is in or not. Serving and shooting is a simple matter of timing against the 3D animated ball, and you need not worry whether it is to the left or right of your player. Certain features uncommon at the time, such as net balls and a ball fetching boy, are also supported. 

- Konami's Soccer (1985):
Soccer is an action game for two players or one player against the computer. You can play the game in one of five skill levels, choose from several different teams, and select the amount of time the match will take. Soccer features throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty kicks and an overhead view of the field which scrolls to follow the action. 

- Konami Rally (1985):
A basic racing game in which you have to finish within the time limit and reach the finish with a given ranking. You 'll start as the last driver in the field and you will have to fight your way forward by over taking your competitors. The number of cars you 'll have to pass will increase each stage. The car has two gears, low and high and tends to slip in curves. 

- Comic Bakery (1984):
A baker tries to bake and deliver bread while fighting raccoons. Pieces of bread are moving along a factory line. The raccoons try to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You have to keep your machinery running and also scaring away the raccoons. If you do that your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off. 

- Pippols (1985):
A young farmer go in search of the pipul, the sacred tree of Buddah, to get the jewel that is hidden inside of it (a rare flower) and take it back to his home. 

- King's Valley (1985):
King's Valley is a puzzle game in which you need to collect all the treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again. 

- Penguin Adventure (1986):
Penguin Adventure: the main character - a male penguin - must save the penguin princess from a sickness that has spread across the penguin world. The cure to the sickness can be found in the Golden Apple of the Golden Apple Tree. In this action packed game, you take control of the male penguin and travel across the lands and seas in search of the Golden Apple, fighting different types of enemies including bats, thunder-striking clouds, and environmental obstacles such as rocks, until finally reaching the princess. The stages feature different types of landscapes such as forests, mountains, caves, and water stages. As you fight your way through, you can also catch flying fish which you can trade at the different types of shops for new equipments and a weapon. 

- Time Pilot (1983):
Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points. 

- Parodius (1987):
This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage. 

- Salamander (1987):
In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.", :release_date => "1998-03-19", :title => "Konami Antiques - MSX Collection Vol. 3", :developer => "KCET", :publisher => "Konami", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25567-1.jpg')

As Alucard, you have a large number of equipment to choose from (daggers, one-handed swords, two-handed swords, fist-type weapons, rods, as well as armor, shields, capes, helmets, accessories, and usable items). Many people will play through this game many times and still not see all of the items within. That’s how many items there are!

Alucard has many techniques at his disposal. First, he has a large set of spells (about 10 or so) that he can perform by using his MP (one of the three main statistics, in addition to HP and Hearts). He can transform into a Wolf, Bat, and Mist (each of which has a few abilities of their own).

Both the playstyle and the league format (double stage with Victory Goal and Final match at the end) were very characteristic and promoted overly offensive, stylish and spectacular football.

A terrifying new device has just been developed...One that could tip the scale of combat in the favour of the side which controls it. This new device was created by the \"Critical Path Corporation\", under the orders of their president, \"Manfred Brando\". The device has the ability to jam all Weapon Systems rendering them utterly useless. 

The terrorist group that attacked the colonies is known as the \"Black Ravens\", led by their fearless leader \"Timoshie Daldahnton\"...Codenamed the \"All Kill Wizard\". Their goal is to rule the galaxy, and the only thing standing in their way is the combined might of the U.N Spacy forces. This new device could change that... 

As Ace Pilot, \"Aegis Focker\", it is up to you and the VFX Raven's \"Alpha Squadron\", to defend the colonists from the terrorists and stop them from using the device to annihilate the U.N forces. You will get to pilot the most advanced Variable Fighters in the U.N arsenal, and fly into the face of danger with your wingmen right beside you. However, things are not as they seem...There is a traitor among the ranks, someone who sympathizes with the terrorists, and has a hidden agenda of their own...Who could it be?...Your mission controller?, your wingmen?, your captain?...maybe even your commander? 

The only way to find out is to play through the entire game!, there are a few key events that will pop-up in the course of your missions, where your choice of action determines the path the story will take and the kind of ending you recieve. Can you save the colonists, stay loyal to your friends, defeat the terrorists and stop the SDF Macross all at once?...it all depends on the path you choose...

1.) Fighter - Your standard Jet-Fighter configuration. Used primarily for Aerial combat. 
2.) Battroid Mech (Giant Robot) configuration. Used primarily for ground missions, or mech to mech combat in mid-air. This mode only allows ou to use your guns as a weapon. 
3.) Gerwalk - Ground Effective Reinforcement of Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint. This mode is basically a hybrid of a jet-fighter and mech. It maintains the appearance of a jet, but the thrusters become the legs and are pointed downwards allowing mid-air hovering.

Above ground, peace returned again. 

Half a year passed, suddenly the Blocks began to overflow in three nations.One after another America, India and Egypt became flooded in blocks. 

Susumu Hori and his Rival Driller, Anna Hottenmeyer; urgently began to dig to the depths of the earth. Meanwhile, Susumu's father, Taizou Hori; Susumu'selder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna's Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu's roomate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster. 

What is the probable cause of this latest incident? 
And, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster? 

Our hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller. 

If all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.

It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game.
The limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card.

It features 7 titles:

- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. 
STORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" 

- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. 

- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. 
You control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. 

- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. 
The player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. 

- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. 
The players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. 

- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. 
The player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. 

- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games. Set in the 1960s, the player takes the role of a secret agent who must save his female partner from a terrorist organization. 
The player takes control of Albatross, a member of Interpol's \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. 
Albatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages.", :release_date => "1997-10-30", :title => "Namco Museum Encore", :developer => "Namco", :publisher => "Namco", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25710-1.jpg')

The name of Puyo Puyo Sun comes from a Japanese pun on \"san\", and also indicates a new Ojama brought into the game. As Sun Puyos were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (三, \"san\" is the Japanese word for the number 3), the name suited the game. 

Just like the predecessors, Puyos fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90°. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time you countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern (in the Game Boy version of this game, it fell randomly). Every time you cleared the screen however, Sun Puyos would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed.

The game features 3 story modes featuring their own character and difficulty: Draco Centauros (Easy), Arle Nadja (Normal) and Schezo Wegey (Hard).

Storyline: 
Satan has once again decided to create another test by using special magic to pull the Sun closer to the Earth on a remote island. This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Carbuncle, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave. Draco loves the hot weather and appears in a bikini, whereas Schezo, who takes refuge in a cave, finds that it's just not cool enough, and decides to find out what's happening.", :release_date => "1997-11-27", :title => "Puyo Puyo Sun - Ketteiban", :developer => "Compile", :publisher => "Compile", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25829-1.jpg')

It is Compile's last recognized Puyo Puyo title in the series before Sega obtained the rights.
Puyo Puyo Box, being a compilation, primarily consists of modes from earlier Puyo Puyo games, but also contains original content.

This game has a plethora of game modes available to the user. It contains ports of \"Puyo Puyo\" and \"Puyo Puyo 2\", as well as a RPG-styled quest mode in which the player plays as Arle and battles against members of the other cast in Puyo Puyo matches. It also houses a \"Stage Clear\" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes.

For the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated.

The key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either \"Puyo Puyo\", \"Puyo Puyo 2\", \"Puyo Puyo Sun\" and \"Puyo Puyo~n\". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place.
