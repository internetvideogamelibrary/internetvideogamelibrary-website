Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.
#In the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.
#The player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.
#
#As the game progresses the player discovers that General Stuart Adams, a high ranking ISA officer, is a traitor and a servant of Joseph Lente (the commanding General of The Third Helghast Special Forces Army) and was responsible for sabotaging the SD platforms, rendering them unable to defend against the Helghast. The Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.
#Jan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha's family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha's brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.
#The team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar. The platform begins to break up and Adams is killed by falling debris while trying to escape.

The area was hit centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium \"whispering rock\", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata.

He is trying to enjoy the remainder of his summer vacation with his friends but he keeps having flash-backs of someone else's memories.
#
#When he meets up with Sora, the two learns they have a special connection with one another. Afterwards, the group will continue their search for King Mickey and Riku. This time, they will travel to new worlds and work with various characters from the Disney and Final Fantasy universes. This includes worlds from not only Disney's animated movies but other movies as well like Pirates of the Caribbean and TRON.
#
#In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora and his friends will battle various enemies including the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, but also a group of enemies called Nobodies. Nobodies are \"nonexistent beings\" who are under the control of Organization XIII - a group of 13 members in black coats that Sora and his friends have reduced down to just half.
#
#Gameplay is very similar to Kingdom Hearts: the player controls Sora with Donald and Goofy helping with their magic and attacks. Sora can use various magic powers as well as use Summon which will call upon the aid of special Disney characters that will temporarily fight alongside him. A new feature of combat are \"Reaction Commands\". Some enemies will leave themselves open during attacks, and if the player presses the Reaction Command button when prompted Sora will take advantage of the situation, either turning an enemy's attack against them, striking from a defenseless side for extra damage, or avoiding an otherwise unavoidable attack. As the trio levels up and progresses in the game they will gain new abilities that they can equip. Also, after Mickey meets the party, if Sora is KO'd the player will have the option of controlling Mickey and defending Sora until he can recover.", :release_date => "2006-03-28", :title => "Kingdom Hearts II", :developer => "Square Enix", :publisher => "Square Enix", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1903-1.jpg')

Some time after the warriors depart, a tremor runs through the castle, and Ico is able to take advantage of it to escape his confines. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda, a captive girl who speaks in an unknown language. Ico helps Yorda escape, but finds that she is hunted by shadow-like creatures (the souls of other horned children sacrificed to the fortress) that attempt to drag her body into the portals from which they emerged. Though Ico cannot be harmed by the shadows and is able to drive them away from Yorda, he finds he cannot defeat the enemies with his simple weapons. The pair make their way through the abandoned castle, eventually arriving at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the fortress and Yorda's mother, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle.

Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.

The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland.

The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering.

The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.

While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.", :release_date => "2002-10-15", :title => "X-Men: Next Dimension", :developer => "Paradox", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4765-1.jpg')

Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.

Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted.

Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious. 
However, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again! Like other games in the R-Type Series, the game is a scrolling shooter where you need to guide a spaceship through various stages and destroy the many enemies (including very large end of level bosses). 
The game features a large variety of spaceships (over 100!) to choose from, each with varying capabilities. Regardless of which ship you choose, you begin the game with limited firepower; you can fire a basic weapon, or hold down a button to charge up and fire a more powerful burst. Occasionally power ups will appear on the screen; collect these to equip your ship with additional weapons, including a variety of lasers, missiles, and other useful items. In addition to the normal game, an AI VS mode is also included. In this mode, you can set up one of your available fighters to be controlled by the computer and then fight it to see who wins in various battles.", :release_date => "2003-06-19", :title => "R-Type Final", :developer => "Irem", :publisher => "Irem", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5390-1.jpg')

Besides having to do this, Marcus is a street-level cop. He is responsible for anything from stopping street fights to stopping gang wars to defusing bombs! Not only this, he can frisk people on the street for contraband, can do trunk searches on cars, as well as issue tickets to speeders.

But if Marcus is gonna do all those things, hes gonna do it his way. Need some cash? Marcus isn't opposed to a bit of extortion from the local pharmacy. Need some a way to stabilize your career after that rampage last week? Plant some evidence on a guy and bring him in. No one will know. Pistols not cutting it for you? The gun stores sell police officers anything, from M4's to flamethrowers to RPGs.

Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. 

The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue \"I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!\" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.

To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them.

    ChuChu Rocket! – Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.
    Puyo Pop Fever – Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.
    Crazy Taxi – Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.
    Super Monkey Ball – The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.
    NiGHTS Into Dreams – NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.
    House of the Dead – A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.
    Virtua Striker – As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.
    Virtua Fighter – Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.
    Space Channel 5 – Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.
    Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg – By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.", :release_date => "2004-11-03", :title => "Sega Superstars", :developer => "Sega", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5398-1.jpg')

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.

The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.

After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost.

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.

The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue.

If you beat the game you may use any gadgets on certain ones. If not, than all minigames will not allow you to use one or no gadgets until the Subfinals. You may not play against bosses or in the Virus-tech World in Verses mode. You may only use up to four gadgets in minigames that allow gadgets, and you may win new prizes from fans which all come from previous Ape Escape games if you win in certain times or with a certain amount of points or coins depending on the minigames. The Prize can be the 3rd prize Fan ID, the 2nd prize Fan letter, or the 1st prize present which could be a new summoning, gadget, vehicle, or clothing. The Gadget could be fiery, electrical, or icy and the vehicle can only be icy.

The Summonings are monkeys, that you gain by getting fan prizes, are used to help you win Levels where you're on foot. They can do things like heal you, cause a sandstorm, attack the opponent directly, etc. Each summoning can only do one thing and you can only have one summoning. Not all summoning came from previous games but two summoning came from the Freaky Monkey Five!

After the Subfinals you may use specials by combining buttons next to each other. Each Characters have different specials. For example, The regular Pipo monkey's strongest special is the RC car and the Stunclub combined and it causes you to throw a banana straight forward, and if it hits an enemy then several monkeys jump out of nowhere and beat up the enemy senseless. It won't always KO in one hit.

You also can fight each other in story mode. There are many place to fight. You can use 5 types of cool gadgets.

The battle system in the game is simplistic but flexible. Character statistics at the game's beginning are preset, and the player may only customize their character's stats through gaining experience points. Experience points are gained by winning battles, and at specific levels the character gains new ability points to spend on enhancements specific to the character class. The ability choices affect the fighting style of the character.

Gameplay is linear, and any current quest must be completed successfully before the story proceeds. There are also relatively few non-player characters (NPCs), of which only those who are part of a quest or side-quest may be interacted with. There are not that many sidequests available in the game, but those available - such as for Keaira and Ipswitch - help players to gain experience and level up. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location at a time in the current region, and are increasingly valuable later in the game.

The game's ruleset is based on a limited set of 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rule-set; compared to other D&D Games there are relatively few rules implemented in the game. There are four playable classes: Human Arcane Archer, Elven Sorceress, Dwarven Fighter and Drow Ranger. Gameplay strategy is different for all characters: the human relies on ranged attacks and stealth, the elf character can cast magic spells, and the dwarf is an all-around fighter. Through updating each character, the characters go to mimic characters of other classes.

A local co-op mode is available, which uses a single non-split screen view. The second player can select one of the unused characters.", :release_date => "2001-12-03", :title => "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance", :developer => "Black Isle", :publisher => "Interplay Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5898-1.jpg')

After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, after being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions.

The game begins in Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game, and in doing so releases Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Cassidy as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse.

As the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him.[7] When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to use their powers and walk in sunlight. On some of his missions Jericho is accompanied by other Darkwatch forces including his new partner, a sultry and vicious temptress named Tala. Eventually, during their night of passion, Tala causes him to bite her and inherits some portion of his power, transforming herself into a half-vampire creature similar to him.[8] She then betrays the Darkwatch from within, allowing the undead hordes to invade its headquarters.

A final showdown ensues with Lazarus, in which Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given for him to side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the west of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala, and if they player chose to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.", :release_date => "2005-08-16", :title => "Darkwatch", :developer => "High Moon Studios", :publisher => "Capcom", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7202-1.jpg')

The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew.

Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You start off in D-Mobb's crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb's rival, Crow. You'll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in.

To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy. You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar. Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you). Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone's been thrown into them.

The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use.

The spell turns the king, King Trode, into a troll; the princess, Medea, into a horse; and the rest of the castle’s inhabitants into plants. The only one left unaffected is the unnamed protagonist, a Trodain guard. The guard, King Trode, and Princess Medea set out on a quest to track down Dhoulmagus and break the spell. They are joined by Yangus, a bandit whose life the hero saves from a collapsing bridge; Jessica, a mage seeking to avenge her brother; and Angelo, a Templar Knight with a penchant for flirting and gambling. Tracking Dhoulmagus' murderous path, the party journeys west, across the ocean. Eventually, the group hunts down Dhoulmagus and kills him, but Dhoulmagus' death fails to break the spell. Jessica claims Dhoulmagus' scepter, and soon after disappears.

Jessica later returns, possessed by the staff and battles the remaining party members in an attempt to murder a young man. After the party releases Jessica from her possession, Jessica tells them that the scepter contains the spirit of Rhapthorne, the Lord of Darkness, who was imprisoned in the scepter long ago by seven sages. He seeks to escape from his prison by killing the descendants of the sages. When Jessica explains this, the scepter takes control of a magician’s dog, Sir Leopold, and kills the magician’s assistant, who was one of the descendants of the sages. The party attempts to seek out and defend the remaining descendants, but Leopold manages to murder most of them, until the scepter comes into the possession of Marcello, Angelo's power hungry half-brother. Marcello kills the last remaining descendant of the sages, but manages to contain Rhapthorne for a time. Eventually, the party engages Marcello for murdering a High priest, expending Marcello's energy and releasing Rhapthorne. The party, aided by the godbird Empryea, faces Rhapthorne and defeats him. With Rhapthorne dead, King Trode, Princess Medea, and the people of Trodain are returned to normal. Months later, the protagonist escorts Medea to Savella Cathedral for her arranged marriage to the spoiled Prince Charmles of Argonia, but before the ceremony can take place, the protagonist and Medea escape from Savella Cathedral and live happily together. In an alternate ending, it is discovered that the protagonist is the lost prince of Argonia.

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...

The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.

Levels that have been visited before might become \"Expedition Missions\" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.", :release_date => "2004-03-02", :title => "Drakengard", :developer => "Cavia", :publisher => "Square Enix", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7228-1.jpg')

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.

Years later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.

In Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.

Within the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.

In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch.

Like in the first game, the player assumes the role of 3 important leaders in ancient China: Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Ce. A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.

For battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game).

Morale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale.

Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.

Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode.

To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. 
One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you.

ESPN celebrates it's 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception.

The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.

Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game.", :release_date => "2004-07-20", :title => "ESPN NFL 2K5", :developer => "Visual Concepts Entertainment, Inc.", :publisher => "SEGA", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7243-1.jpg')

You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more.

There are a few special game modes as well. You have access to the skills mode, which was also found in last year's game. You can choose accuracy shooting, puck control, hardest shot, fastest skater, and a few more. There is also a Party Mode, which is set up for one to four players (you and friends or you and the computer), which pits you in fast action games.

The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not common. If any common answers remain after that team's third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus points.

The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet.

The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo).

Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities.

Lazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren't much use against the incorporeal.

Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way: shooting them until they stop moving.

In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. 

You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough…

Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.

Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license.

As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.", :release_date => "2002-05-09", :title => "Headhunter", :developer => "Amuze", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7295-1.jpg')

In the Campaign mode, the player is William Crowe, a young pilot who survives the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but loses his brother. Crowe vows to avenge his bother's death, pursuing the squadron responsible though the major battles in the Pacific. The game follows the player's quest from Pearl Harbor, to Wake Island, Marshall Islands, Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, Gilbert Islands, Marianas, Philippines, and finally Iwo Jima.

As players progress through the campaigns, they earn new planes, including fighters, dive-bombers, torpedo-bombers, and medium bombers. Early in the game the player only has the most basic fighters; like the Warhawk and Wildcat. As they complete missions and progress through the campaign, they are awarded new planes.

The game features over thirty famous planes including: F6F Hellcat, P-38 Lightning, TBF Avenger, F4U Corsair, B25 Mitchell, P-51 Mustang, Seafire, A6M Zero \"Zeke\", J2M Raiden \"Jack\", Ki-84 Hayate \"Frank\", ME262 and FW190.

Similar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences. Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs. While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping.

You have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths.

You can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie. You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.

One of the most important objects is the Ranger Station. With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters. If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart. If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.

In order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed. The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be. Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.

The different dino's require different resources. Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows. Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.

Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.

Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos.

Battles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes.

Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or 'Vision'), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the \"Dream Spirit\", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.

But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too.

You'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop.

The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces.

Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.

The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the \"Get In, Get Up, and Get Out\" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.

As the Reploid conflicts proceed after the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: \"Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?\", leading him to the decision of \"I've had enough of this violence.\" Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the \"Red Alert Syndicate\", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that.

However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. 

Eventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China, South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North Korea, competing for power in the troubled region. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.

Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.

Players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck. 

Players have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done. It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.

Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.

So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.

Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents.

Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.

With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for \"face sculpting\" - changing the different features.

All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.

Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a \"Remote Weapon System\", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.", :release_date => "2009-06-23", :title => "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen", :developer => "Krome Studios", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8794-1.jpg')

At the beginning of the story an earthquake has caused vast portions of the land to disappear! Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there.

Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn't have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden.", :release_date => "2006-04-25", :title => "Atelier Iris 2 The Azoth Of Destiny", :developer => "Gust", :publisher => "NIS America", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9629-1.jpg')

From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you.

The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns.

Combat is heavily based on \"finishing moves\" and Jen's ability to transform into demonic forms.

The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower.

The storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called \"DreadZone\" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy.

There are 10 total weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer.

Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.", :release_date => "2005-10-25", :title => "Ratchet: Deadlocked", :developer => "Insomniac Games", :publisher => "Sony", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9781-1.jpg')

The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment.

Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors.

In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.

Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time.

Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.

The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission.

The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage.

The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.", :release_date => "2011-03-29", :title => "WWE All Stars", :developer => "THQ", :publisher => "THQ", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10833-1.jpg')

Everything from the first The Suffering has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel.

The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque's family. But it won't be easy, as the hideous creatures from the first game have now overrun the streets of Baltimore.

The player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas \"Tommy\" Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver and enforcer for the Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.

Through the events of the game's story, Tommy begins to rise through the ranks of the Salieri family, which is currently battling the competing Morello family, led by the sharply-dressed Don Morello. Eventually becoming disillusioned by his life of crime and violence, Tommy arranges to meet a detective (Detective Norman) in order to tell him his story, to be given witness protection, and to aid the detective in the destruction of the Salieri crime family.

Shadow Hearts is a turn-based Role Playing Game that combines a haunting storyline with a unique battle system that is user controlled.

Haseo has earned a few upgrades via a mysterious hacker who broke into his account and added a new set of powers. These powers, called the \"Xth\" form, allow Haseo to use a pair of pistols with blades on the barrel. With these weapons Haseo can deal greater damage and perform a \"double trigger\" attack by invoking a special ability. 

The level cap is increased to 150, and gamers can add up to 22 additional avatars to their party.

While only one character can be controlled at any given time, all share the same life bar referred to as a Soul Gage. Each character also has distinct physical and magical attacks to use on enemies.

Gathering items and weapons plays an integral role in character development, as the leveling-up system found in traditional RPGs has been eliminated. Instead, a character's attributes are influenced by his or her equipment. Not only do changes made to an outfit alter ability in battle, but they affect the way other characters perceive players as well.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.

These trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers. 

The storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die.

The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.", :release_date => "2006-06-15", :title => "Trapt", :developer => "Tecmo", :publisher => "Tecmo", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12901-1.jpg')

To free both his demon and himself, Ari embarks on a dangerous and involved quest to rid the world of seven other rival demons.

Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring \"stroke-shaded\" animation-style graphics, a \"Wild West\" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.

Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The \"drifters\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.

As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed \"expressive communication\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.


Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles.

Since the runaway success of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, the GTA games have been praised by players and vilified by politicians. All three 128-bit generation GTA games -- Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas -- are included in this box set.

Grand Theft Auto III casts players as a low-level thug in a grungy, New York-styled urban game world called Liberty City. Liberty City is made up of three districts, and in all, the game offers 72 different missions, many of which can be played in any order. As the player's character completes jobs available in one part of the city, other areas and assignments open up to him. Along with this purposeful design of an open-ended, non-linear storyline, many other features popular in earlier versions of the game return in this release as well, including a diverse variety of deadly weapons, busy streets full of self-involved pedestrians, and eight different radio station soundtracks to listen to while inside the vehicles.

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same open-ended style of play as its violent, \"M\"-rated predecessor, but in an area twice as large as Liberty City, and with a completely different theme. Seemingly inspired by television's stylish crime drama, Miami Vice, Vice City takes place in the 1980s. Criminals wear pastel-colored suits, bikini-clad women relax on sandy beaches, and palm tree-lined streets are bustling with showy sports cars and zippy motorcycles.

Like its immediate predecessor, San Andreas strives to provide a wide, deep foundation for its free-form criminal gameplay by setting the story in a slightly exaggerated representation of a familiar (if not glorified) American subculture. As Vice City seemed inspired by Miami Vice, and the pastel-decked, \"me generation\" ideals of the early '80s, San Andreas is set in a time and place suggested by films like Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, or Colors. Players take the role of Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, who thought he had escaped the gangland lifestyle by moving away from his Los Santos home. When his mother is murdered, he returns to the neighborhood of his childhood, only to become embroiled with threats and danger from all sides.

Editor's Note: The version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included in this compilation has been rated \"M\" by the ESRB, and contains no working remnants of the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" sequence found in the title's original release.", :release_date => "2006-12-11", :title => "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy", :developer => "Rockstar North", :publisher => "", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12909-1.jpg')

Players must eliminate the threat of the virus and the hostile creatures it has created, all without becoming infected.

The game is played from a third-person perspective, and all of the environments are rendered in real-time, allowing the camera to cinematically swoop around for the best view possible. The camera can also be configured into a manual first-person view aim, allowing for extremely precise shooting as well as a guide to the general layout of the environment.

Extermination for the PlayStation 2 derives its roots and plays similarly to the survival horror game Resident Evil, but in a new twist to the genre, players will have to worry about becoming infected with the virus that has swept through the Fort Stewart installation. The infection level is measured by a percentage, and once that percentage reaches 100 percent, a parasite begins to spread throughout your body. Your health is dramatically reduced and certain elements (such as water) decrease your health percentage greatly. If you do not get a special treatment known as the MTS and find a medical bed in the installation, the infection takes over and turns you into a zombie-like mutant.", :release_date => "2001-07-24", :title => "Extermination", :developer => "Deep Space Inc.", :publisher => "Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12924-1.jpg')

Players will explore five strange new lands that hold unimagined treasures for those brave and skilled enough to claim them. Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas. The player's character is quick with a sword and can increase her swashbuckling skills with experience. 

Similarly, wealth gained from adventure and victory allows the pirate to upgrade to larger ships with more deadly weaponry. A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers. Sea battles involve a realistic combination of positioning and timing, as tall ships align themselves to fire on enemy vessels from port- and starboard-mounted weapons and time must be spent reloading the powerful cannons and guns after each shot. The ability to repair damage on the fly is also an important strategic consideration in ship-to-ship fights.

Though the gameplay of this 3D adventure is oriented towards fast action, several elements of role-playing are also incorporated, to move the story along and involve the player more deeply. The lead character Katarina de Leon plots a thoughtful course for her career on the open seas. The \"Black Kat\" sets sail to uncover mysteries and position herself in circumstances that will increase her overall status among other pirates, securing a position of power. In addition to Katarina's well-developed storyline, the game's \"Captain vs. Captain\" battle mode allows a more combat-intensive, freeform style of play.


Pirates ? The Legend of Black Kat, formerly known as Pirates of Skull Cove, is Westwood's next-generation pirate game with epic ship battles and thrilling swordplay, starring Black Kat.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.

His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.


As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are.

In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.

When engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.

Throughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance.

Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables.

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. 

Weapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.", :release_date => "2001-07-13", :title => "Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse", :developer => "Metro3D", :publisher => "Metro3d", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15210-1.jpg')

As with previous titles in the action-oriented series, players choose from a variety of stout heroes and noble warriors before engaging in historically inspired battles featuring hundreds of combatants. While the series has been criticized for its lack of significant changes from release to release, Dynasty Warriors 6 adds a number of enhancements to the well-traveled franchise. Though it lacks the graphical flourishes of the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS2 edition of Dynasty Warriors 6 offers ten new scenarios, five additional stages, and host of new weapons. The emphasis is still on defeating throngs of enemies with swords, giant hammers, polearms, and other weapons, with lengthy combo chains possible by varying attacks.

As players become more skilled in combat, they can choose from a variety of skills to customize their heroes as they see fit. A new \"renbu\" system allows characters to earn immediate combat bonuses through dexterous play, but these bonuses are lost once the battle is over. Characters also have the ability to swim across water and scale walls to perform surprise attacks on enemy camps. Another change is the omission of bodyguards, so players must go it alone instead of having a personal entourage. In their place is a faithful steed that can be called upon in a pinch to make hasty retreats or to charge at full gallop into groups. The character's horse will also level up along with characters, improving attributes in speed or power in combat. Featured game types include Musou Mode, a character-specific campaign, Challenge Mode, offering specific goals to complete, and Free, which involves building a character's stats on any unlocked battlefield. Players can also team-up with a friend via split-screen display.", :release_date => "2008-11-18", :title => "Dynasty Warriors 6", :developer => "Omega Force", :publisher => "KOEI", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15468-1.jpg')

The game uses a real physics engine which handles the movement of all objects, promising added realism. You'll be able to stack up objects in order to form a stepping ground for scaling a tall wall.

It was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.
The game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 60% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.
While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.", :release_date => "2008-06-28", :title => "Guitar Hero Aerosmith", :developer => "Neversoft", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18551-1.jpg')

Unlike the earlier game, where players were restricted to the Free mode when playing as the likes of Lu Bu, this latest iteration offers each of the seven previously unaligned characters a new scenario (or \"Musou\"). These scenarios take place across stages from the original Dynasty Warriors that have been remixed, providing players with new objectives, scenery, and cut-scenes. As an added bonus, players can import everything they've unlocked from Dynasty Warriors 3 into this game for an enhanced experience.

Players are also given free reign in regards to bodyguard customization. Bodyguards can be named, assigned weapons and items, and their genders and uniforms modified to taste. Other additions include a collection of new weapons and items, a fifth weapon for each officer, new difficulty levels, and an \"Arrange\" mode in which players can tinker with the placement of characters in the game's opening movie. 

Four Challenge modes have also been introduced: Balancing Act, Speed Demon, Combo Mania, and Iron Man. The first has players battling atop a bridge, with the objective being to knock as many enemy waves off the bridge before you yourself fall. Speed Demon is a footrace across an entire level, requiring both players to navigate hazards and fight off enemies en route to the finish line. Combo Mania is a gratuitous display of force as players beat up hapless hordes in search of combo points.

Treasure chests are spread out throughout areas which contain either items that can be used outside of battle or equipment which is used during battle. Although enemies can sometimes be found throughout areas, there are many scripted battle sequences that occur throughout the game. In battles, the player controls one character throughout the whole battle (usually Orphen, though certain sections of the game have you play as a different character) and can use three different pieces of equipment. Types of equipment include: melee weapons, spells and elemental shields. The player can also press square to use their shield. The characters remain stationary during battle, only moving towards enemies to use melee weapons. Though battles are set up like turn-based battles, the battles occur in real time meaning that the player, allies and enemies can all attack at any time. If the controlled character dies during battle, the game ends and the player is returned to the title screen. However, the player can pause the battle and change equipment at any time, restarting the battle in the process. Because you can only save at certain points in the game in the form of checkpoints, this strategy can be used to avoid having to reload your file and make your way back to the battle if your character dies. ~Wikipedia", :release_date => "2000-10-23", :title => "Orphen: Scion of Sorcery", :developer => "Shade", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18999-1.jpg')

The hard-core strategy framework is fleshed out with a variety of mission types, branching storylines, and an embellished adherence to the actual history and culture of the setting.

Features in this edition include the ability to manage both political and military aspects of the empire, at the same time, allowing players to continue to negotiate while their troops are in battle. While this version of the game resumes the limitation that player characters must be of the Ruler class, officer development has been revised to allow greater control in developing followers.

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.

Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.

Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.

The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted.

Once, Raph infiltrated Max Winters' tower (as Nightwatcher), and eavesdropped on a conversation with Winters and Karai. Raph was then defeated by one of the Stone Generals.

The turtles, however, managed to defeat the Generals, the portal opened, and the monsters returned to their dimension. Yaotl then thanks the turtles and dies happy and free from guilt.

Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.
The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared.

Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory.
