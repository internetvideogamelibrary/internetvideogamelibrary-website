It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.

After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his \"brainwashing level\" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.

Mega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together.

The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.
It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.
The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9√ò Ragnar√∂k; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9√ò2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.", :release_date => "1993-12-10", :title => "R-Type III: The Third Lightning", :developer => "Irem", :publisher => "DSI Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2345-1.jpg')

At the beginning of each stage, the player is given a choice of four protagonists to control: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Peach, credited in the game as merely \"Princess.\" Each character has different strengths; Mario is a well-rounded character; Luigi can jump the highest of the four; Toad can run and pluck vegetables the fastest but can't jump well; and Peach can jump the farthest, due to her ability to hover for a short time, though she is the slowest runner. All characters have the ability to increase the height of their jump by ducking briefly before they jump.

Unlike the previous and following Mario games, no enemies can be defeated by jumping on them. Instead, the player character must throw objects at enemies, such as vegetables plucked from the ground. Certain opponents can be picked up and thrown as well, and several levels feature blocks marked with the word \"POW\", which when picked up and thrown kill all the enemies on screen at impact, similar to the one in Mario Bros.

The game features a life meter, a then-unusual feature in the series. The player begins each stage with two points of health, represented by red hexagons, and can increase the number of health points in the meter by collecting mushrooms. Health can be replenished by floating hearts, which appear after a certain number of opponents have been defeated. The invincibility star from the previous game appears, with a player needing to collect five cherries to acquire it.

Each stage contains one or more hidden flasks of potion. When plucked and thrown, a potion creates a door to Sub-Space, an alternate world in which coins are collected instead of vegetables when plucked. The mushrooms used to increase the health meter can also be found here. The player automatically leaves Sub-Space after a short time. The coins collected are used in a slot machine mini-game played between stages. This mini-game is the chief means of obtaining additional lives. In addition to the mushrooms and slot machine coins, several Sub-Spaces are also used as warp zones; these involve the use of vases as pipes.", :release_date => "2001-03-21", :title => "Super Mario Advance: Super Mario Bros. 2", :developer => "Nintendo", :publisher => "Nintendo", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2347-1.jpg')

When he finally reaches Bowser's Castle, Kamek demands that Yoshi gives back Baby Mario. Suddenly, Baby Bowser wakes up and tries to ride Yoshi, but Yoshi knocks him off. Kamek then enlarges Baby Bowser to a gigantic size, destroying most of the castle in the process. After fighting and defeating him, Bowser is reverted to his normal size and is unconscious.

She encounters an X Parasite, virions that can replicate their hosts' physical appearances and memories, killing them afterward. Samus is unknowingly infected by the virus, and proceeds to return to the BSL station, when she suddenly loses consciousness and is ejected from her ship before it crashes into a nearby asteroid belt. The Galactic Federation recovers her body and discovers that the X Parasite infected Samus's central nervous system. They counteract the parasite's damage by creating a vaccine using Samus's cellular sample from the remains of a Metroid that Samus previously contacted. The vaccine cures Samus and also gives her Metroid-like characteristics, including the ability to absorb and use the nuclei of X Parasites for nourishment, and the Metroid's vulnerability to extremely cold temperatures. Her infected Power Suit is sent to the BSL station for examination, although parts of the suit are bonded to her body and cannot be removed, forming a partially-armored suit known as the eponymous Fusion Suit. The Federation sends Samus to investigate an explosion aboard the BSL station. While there, she learns that the space station is swarming with organisms that are infected with X Parasites. A group of X Parasites manage to recover and use components of Samus's infected Power Suit to transform into the SA-X, a form of the parasite that partially mimics Samus at full power and possesses the Ice Beam that can exploit Samus's weakness to cold temperatures. Samus escapes from the SA-X before it attacks her, and continues exploring the space station. She discovers a restricted lab, which the Galactic Federation is secretly using to breed Metroids. Suddenly, the SA-X appears once again, and attempts to destroy the lab, with itself in it. Samus narrowly escapes the lab before it is destroyed, and later learns that the SA-X managed to asexually reproduce before perishing, subsequently cloning itself. In addition, Samus learns that the Galactic Federation plans to capture the X and the SA-X for further study. Samus is certain that the Federation underestimates the destructive power of the X Parasites, and takes it upon herself to destroy the BSL station by setting it on a collision course with SR388. As she prepares to exit the station, she encounters an Omega Metroid, which proceeds to destroy one of the SA-X. Samus absorbs the nucleus of the SA-X and uses her newly-restored Ice Beam to destroy the Omega Metroid, before escaping to her ship, which extracts her from the space station before it collides with SR388.", :release_date => "2002-11-01", :title => "Metroid Fusion", :developer => "Nintendo Research & Development 1", :publisher => "Nintendo", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2638-1.jpg')

Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each \"level\" gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which determine the number of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2035, the available weapons are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears; though a handgun is available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack. Items and other accessories can be found by defeating enemies or by purchasing items from the game's shop.

Similar to previous games in the series, Aria of Sorrow is set within Dracula's castle, which is further subdivided into several areas that the player traverses. These areas feature different components, such as different enemies, varying terrain characteristics, and a unique piece of theme music. Similar to most platform games, progression between areas is limited by the abilities the player currently has.[12] While the method in which the player progresses through the game is initially linear, the player's options become more diverse as the number of character abilities increases.", :release_date => "2003-05-06", :title => "Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow", :developer => "Konami", :publisher => "Konami", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3349-1.jpg')

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.", :release_date => "2005-06-27", :title => "Fantastic 4", :developer => "7 Studios", :publisher => "Activision", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3462-1.jpg')

In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.

As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.

    Levels do not always have the usual rectangular shape. Some of them are jagged or have walls inside them, which forces the player to change strategy.

Dr. Bian Zoldark, while investigating the meteor, also found out that the creators of the Extra-Over Technology were heading to Earth to reclaim it. In order to defend earth, the government starts to develop a group of humanoid mecha, known as Personal Troopers.
The alien race that created Extra-Over Technology, called the Aerogaters by the Earth Federal Government, initially attacks an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the solar system. This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth Federation Army. Talks are arranged to take place at a secret facility in Antarctica, but the talks are targeted by a rogue faction called the Divine Crusaders.
The Divine Crusaders destroys the Aerogater delegation, then turn on the Federation forces.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

As is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP.), which allow them to gain levels.

In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \"generic\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.

Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.

Most games in the Shining Force series (with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather) also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.", :release_date => "2004-06-08", :title => "Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon", :developer => "Amusement Vision", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3682-1.jpg')

Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game.", :release_date => "2003-12-02", :title => "The Sims: Bustin' Out", :developer => "Griptonite Games", :publisher => "EA Games", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3688-1.jpg')

The player controls Sonic the Hedgehog, who can unlock Cream the Rabbit and her Chao, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna after defeating Doctor Eggman in specific boss battles. A fifth character, Amy Rose, can be unlocked after completing all of the game with each character.[4] Each character has their own unique moves and abilities; for example, Cream and Tails can fly, while Amy can swing a hammer throughout levels.


Cream in a 3D \"special stage\"
In the tradition of past Sonic games, gameplay consists of moving quickly through levels, collecting rings and defeating enemies. Levels in the game are divided into seven \"zones\", each consisting of two acts of normal gameplay then a boss battle, where the player fights Doctor Eggman in order to stop Eggman from \"building a Dr. Eggman Empire by kidnapping the animals and turning them into robots\". The player collects rings as a form of health; when they are attacked by an enemy, their rings bounce in all directions. If they are hit by an enemy and have no rings, they lose a life. The player can also collect seven \"special rings\" to access \"special stages\", where Chaos Emeralds are found. \"Special stages\" are on a 3D plane, where the character tries to obtain a set number of rings before time runs out in order to collect a Chaos Emerald. After beating all zones and finding all seven Chaos Emeralds, an alternate final act is unlocked. When that act is beaten, a sound test feature and a boss time-attack feature are unlocked, along with the Tiny Chao Garden, where toys for Cream's Chao, Cheese,[4] can be purchased with rings earned in-game. Various mini-games can also be played in the Tiny Chao Garden.

Other game modes include a \"time-attack\" mode where the player tries to beat a specific act in the shortest amount of time, and a multiplayer mode, where players can race each other through unlocked acts.", :release_date => "2003-03-09", :title => "Sonic Advance 2", :developer => "Sonic Team", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3692-1.jpg')

Sonic Advance 3 also introduced a new game feature called \"Tag Action\". Tag Action is similar to Knuckles' Chaotix: the player picks two characters and controls one while the other will just follow along controlled by the computer (or player two in multiplayer mode). Additionally, in a feature first seen in Knuckles' Chaotix the character can pick up the teammate by holding R, and then release them to use special abilities. Certain pairings, such as pairing Sonic and Tails or Amy and Cream, give the player access to the trick moves from the previous game.

At the start of the game, only Sonic and Tails are playable. By completing certain levels with Sonic as the team leader, Knuckles, Cream and Amy become playable.

The games features seven main levels (Route 99, Sunset Hill, Ocean Base, Toy Kingdom, Twinkle Snow, Cyber Track and Chaos Angel), each with their own \"Zone Map\". These maps have three acts which can be played in any order, but all three must be played before the boss can be fought. These maps also contain two mini-games in which extra lives can be earned. The player can change between maps by entering the \"Sonic Factory\". Here, the player can also change characters and access the level's \"Chao Playground\", which contains all the Chao found in that level. The player needs to find 10 per level in order to access the Special Stage and earn Chaos Emeralds.

Two additional levels follow Chaos Angel - the final boss, \"Altar Emerald\" (The shrine of the Master Emerald) and the extra boss, \"Nonaggression\", which can only be accessed when playing as Sonic after all seven emeralds have been collected.", :release_date => "2004-06-07", :title => "Sonic Advance 3", :developer => "Sonic Team", :publisher => "Sega", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3693-1.jpg')

Unfortunately Butler malfunctions and the Professor has failed to equip it with an \"off\" switch. Spyro manages to short Butler out by luring him into a power generator, then the peephole machine malfunctions and the hole in the fabric of space begins to expand rapidly.
A terrified Professor tells Spyro about \"Hearts\" - magical objects with very special properties and the only way to control the problem. The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores.
After Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Rypto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro. After being defeated, Ripto captures him and Sparx. Butler reappears, and the Professor orders him to trap Ripto. Ripto, now incapacitated, yields the final heart and the Professor permanently seals the hole in space.

Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.", :release_date => "2006-11-14", :title => "Yggdra Union: We'll Never Fight Alone", :developer => "Sting", :publisher => "Atlus", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4035-1.jpg')

Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking. The big catch with Yoshi Topsy-Turvy is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate. A meter on the upper right corner of the screen shows which way the system is being held at any time. Rotate the system to help Yoshi stay on the path and make it past perils and through the varied stages.
Go full tilt! By tilting your Game Boy Advance, you'll tilt the environment around Yoshi, knocking over enemies, swinging pendulums, and letting Yoshi run up walls and leap huge pits! Will this ending be happy? All of Yoshi's Island is trapped in a storybook, and only by meeting the challenges of each chapter will you succeed.

Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

There are four main passages in addition to the Entry Passage and \"Final\" Golden Pyramid: the Emerald, Topaz, Ruby, and Sapphire Passages, in order of difficulty. The Emerald Passage is themed around nature. The Ruby Passage is themed around mechanics and technology. The Topaz Passage is themed around toys, games, and other \"playtime\" ideas. The Sapphire Passage is themed around horror and danger, prominently involving ghosts and the like.

There are four levels in a passage. To progress to the next level in a passage, a player has to find the Keyzer in the previous level (a Keyzer is a floating key-nosed creature that promptly disappears after the player uses it). After the four levels comes a Mini-game Shop and the Boss Room. To enter the Boss Room, the player must find the four pieces of the passage's namesake gem in each level (a total of four gems and 16 pieces). Also, a player can find a CD in each level, which unlocks music in the CD Room. Upon entering a level, one has unlimited time to find treasure, beat up enemies, and such. Enemies, when defeated, give coins and health orbs. After collecting a full bar of health orbs, the player receives one extra heart (out of 8). However, the player can't return to the pyramid (and thus have all of their treasure saved) until they open the portal again via a Frog Switch. Upon hitting the switch, a time limit (which varies depending on the game's difficulty setting and level itself) is placed, and many blocks in the level appear or disappear. For some levels, this results in a rush back to the portal the same way the player came. In others, totally new areas are exposed. If Wario fails to reach the portal within the time limit, he begins to lose coins. Once all of his coins are gone, he is kicked out of the level (as if he had lost all of his health) and is left with no treasure.


Wario about to fight the first boss, Spoiled Rotten.
At the end of each passage, Wario encounters a boss room. He must destroy a boss within a set time limit to win the treasure within the boss rooms (if Wario takes too long but manages to win before the limit is up, some treasure may be withheld). Before each battle, Wario will enter a hall way consisting of two doors. One is a shop which uses mini-game coins as currency; in it, Wario can buy various power-ups and weapons that deal damage to the boss right before the battle.", :release_date => "2001-11-19", :title => "Wario Land 4", :developer => "Nintendo", :publisher => "Nintendo", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5493-1.jpg')

The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.

Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick.

The idea is simple: form rectangles of larger than 3x2 to make them disappear from play. The pieces can be rotated in 90 degree variations, important to get these tiles into the littlest slots on the field. You can't place same colors on top of each other, but you can place other colors on top of already placed shapes to remove them from play. There are three variations: in \"Puzzle,\" the challenge is to remove all shapes from play with the set amount of pieces. In \"Wipeout\", you've got two minutes to remove all shapes from play with an infinite amount of pieces. And in \"Marathon,\" the challenge is to constantly place and remove shapes as long as you can, trying to keep the session alive as the playfield gets eaten away from the outside in.", :release_date => "2004-12-07", :title => "It's Mr. Pants", :developer => "Rare, rareware", :publisher => "Thq", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20886-1.jpg')

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

Blizzard re-released the game for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The GBA port is identical to the SNES version, but the password feature has been removed and replaced with three save slots, meaning the player cannot replay any level at any time.", :release_date => "2003-03-03", :title => "The Lost Vikings", :developer => "Blizzard Entertainment", :publisher => "Blizzard Entertainment", :coverart_remote_url => 'http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24956-1.jpg')

As the name suggests, the games are mostly played on backyard lots, although some fields, like the Gater Flats swamp, probably don't exist in many kids' backyards. Players have the choice of creating custom characters for their team or recruiting kid versions of Major League Baseball stars like Alex Rodriguez, Pedro Martinez, Ichiro, and Carlos Delgado. In addition to season mode, players can play pickup games, compete in home run derbies and fielder's challenges, and select from three different difficulty levels for each mode. Claiming victory in these categories will unlock additional MLB players and stadiums, plus the ability to upgrade current players with moves such as fireball pitches. Fans of the BACKYARD sports series will enjoy building a team of kid versions of their favorite MLB stars.

Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team.

The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.", :release_date => "2001-10-29", :title => "Gadget Racers", :developer => "Takara", :publisher => "Conspiracy Entertainment")

Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time.
