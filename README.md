================

Internet Video Game Library is a website designed to help users to mantain a collection and tracking of games. It aims to allow users to input when they started and finished playing a game, and also to keep track how many games they played, challenge themselves to finish a number of games in a year, and play games they have bought but are still on their shelves.

Code formatting
-------
This project uses rubocop for code formatting. You should set it up in your editor and also set up lefthook (with `lefthook install -a`) to get warnings when pushing a branch with rubocop issues.

Setting up
-------

This project uses PostgreSQL as database, minimum version 9.6 (recommended 13) and ElasticSearch for searching the games (v1.7).
