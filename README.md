================

Internet Video Game Library is a website designed to help users to mantain a collection and tracking of games. It aims to allow users to input when they started and finished playing a game, and also to keep track how many games they played, challenge themselves to finish a number of games in a year, and play games they have bought but are still on their shelves.
